        <p>a b s t r a c t Context: Software process improvement (SPI) aims to increase the effectiveness of a software organization. Many studies indicate that the strategic alignment is a critical factor for the SPI success. However, little is known about practical approaches to achieving and maintaining such alignment. Objective: The goal of this study is to evaluate the validation evidence of the existing approaches to the strategic alignment of SPI. Method: We develop a search protocol that combines database search and snowballing to perform the systematic literature review and evaluate empirical studies by applying rigor and relevance criteria. To evaluate the efficiency of our protocol, we use a “quasi-gold standard” to compute the sensitivity and precision of the search. Result: We identified 30 studies (18 empirical) and 19 approaches to strategic alignment of SPI from 495 retrieved studies. Only three out of the 18 empirical studies were rated as high in the categories rigor and relevance, suggesting the need for a stronger validation of the approaches. Conclusion: We conclude that the lack of empirical validation indicates that the results of the existing approaches have not been adequately transferred to practitioners yet, calling for more rigorous studies on the subject.</p>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>
        Software organizations need to improve their work processes
continuously to meet the growing demands for products and
services. Many standards and models have been proposed to assist
in process improvement strategies, but the selection of the
practices to be improved depends on the organizational context,
culture, and priorities
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">(Humphrey, 1989)</xref>
        . More important, the success
of a software process improvement (SPI) initiative hinges on the
business results that it can generate
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">(Ebert, 1999)</xref>
        , so an SPI
initiative needs to be aligned with the organization’s business goals. In
fact, many studies
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">(Bayona et al., 2012; Dybå, 2000, 2003, 2005)</xref>
        show that the alignment between SPI and business goals is a
critical factor for the success of an SPI initiative. For example,
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">Bayona
et al. (2012)</xref>
        list the alignment with the business strategy and goals
as one of 16 critical factors for the implementation success of
process improvement; and
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">Dybå’s studies (Dybå, 2000</xref>
        , 2003, 2005)
stress that business orientation is one of the key facilitating
factors for SPI success.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both for-profit and non-profit software organizations have
organizational goals defined by the senior managers. Improvements
in a software process can be derived from the organizational goals
in a top-down SPI planning
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">(ISO, 2013)</xref>
        or aligned with the
business goals in a bottom-up SPI strategy as in an agile environment
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40 ref41 ref60 ref61">(Ringstad et al., 2011; Qumer and Henderson-Sellers, 2008;
Lepmets and McBride, 2012)</xref>
        . Regardless of the scenario, an SPI
initiative invariably demands changes in a software process.
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref53">Münch
et al. (2012)</xref>
        emphasize that changes in software processes must
be carefully planned because they rely on humans to be effective,
depend on the organizational and business context, and represent
significant costs for an organization. Thus, any change in a
software process can be seen as a strategic decision. As the alignment
of SPI with business goals involves changes in a software process
and is a strategic decision, we call it the strategic alignment of SPI.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite the importance of strategic alignment of SPI and
the existence of several approaches to such alignment
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1 ref11 ref4 ref68 ref7">(Barreto
and Rocha, 2010; Becker et al., 2008; Debou and
KuntzmannCombelles, 2000; Guzmán et al., 2010; Trienekens et al., 2005;
Albuquerque et al., 2009)</xref>
        , Lepmets et al.
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40 ref41">Lepmets et al. (2012)</xref>
        emphasize that it is still not clear how to achieve the strategic
alignment in practice.
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">Kuhrmann et al. (2015)</xref>
        go beyond and state of
that the SPI research field is being shaped by numerous proposals
that provide no evidence on their feasibility, advantages, and
disadvantages. The technology transfer model proposed by
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">Gorschek
et al. (2006)</xref>
        and
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">Gorschek (2015)</xref>
        defines the steps for validating
the outcome of research (i.e., a candidate solution) before its
release to practitioners. The model stresses the need for an industry
validation, in addition to the academic validation, to provide
evidence of the usability and scalability of any candidate solution. We
argue that a proper validation of any proposed approach to the
strategic alignment of SPI should follow this technology transfer
model.
      </p>
      <p>
        The conjecture we want to investigate with this systematic
literature review (SLR) is that there is insufficient evidence of the
validation of the proposed approaches to the strategic alignment
of SPI. To evaluate the gap between the research proposals and the
scientific evidence of strategic alignment of SPI, we review the
literature and follow the evidence-based software engineering (EBSE)
proposed in
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">Kitchenham et al. (2004)</xref>
        and
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14 ref16">Dybå et al. (2005)</xref>
        to
track down the evidence that can confirm or refute our conjecture.
EBSE tries to close the gap between research and practice by
stimulating methodological rigor of empirical studies while
emphasizing their relevance to practice (Dybå and Dingsøyr, 2008). Our SLR
modifies the checklist for rigor-relevance assessment of empirical
studies presented by
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">Ivarsson and Gorschek (2010)</xref>
        , adapting some
criteria to assess the empirical evidence of existing approaches to
strategic alignment of SPI.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following a brief background on strategic management,
information technology governance, and decision-making processes for
strategic alignment of SPI in Section 2, we detail our method to
answer the research questions in Section 3. Our search protocol
applies a combination of two well-known search strategies: database
search and snowballing. A broader database search defines a
snowballing start set to mitigate the risks of researchers’ bias. Our
protocol also includes quality assurance activities, such as audits by
independent researchers and measurement of an inter-observer
agreement, to enhance the reliability of our results. These design
strategies and quality assurance activities contribute to making our
final dataset a strong candidate for a “gold standard”, as defined by
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref72">Zhang et al. (2011)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>We answer the research questions in Section 4 based on an
extensive analysis of the results. First, we present the results of the
search protocol, the classification of the studies in theoretical or
empirical, and the values of the rigor and relevance assessment of
the empirical studies. Second, we show the distribution over time
of the selected studies and the citation graph. The distribution over
time contributes to an analysis of the evolution of the research on
the subject while the citation graph assists the analysis of
influence among approaches by the visualization of the citation-graph
connectivity. Third, we present the scores of rigor and relevance
of the studies using a bubble chart, which allows a visual analysis
of the overall quality of the empirical studies. Fourth, we evaluate
the search protocol using the values of sensitivity and precision of
the search before and after the snowballing to quantify the
snowballing contribution to the strategy efficiency.</p>
      <p>In Section 5, we discuss our findings, raise open questions
about the SLR results, and discuss the limitations of our study
through an analysis of the threats to the validity of our method
and results. We also describe implications of our results to
practitioners and researchers. We conclude the paper in Section 6 by
proposing a research agenda with the challenges that must be met
to offer practical support for the strategic alignment of SPI. The list
of the selected studies and the criteria used for the rigor-relevance
assessment, are presented in the Appendices. In summary, the
paper makes the following contributions:
1. A systematic literature review (SLR) protocol that combines
database search with snowballing procedures to balance
sensitivity (recall) and precision (Section 3).
2. A dataset of existing approaches to strategic alignment of SPI
that can be used as a quasi-gold standard in future studies
(Section 4).
3. An assessment of the methodological rigor and relevance to
practice of the identified empirical studies (Section 4).
4. A discussion of possible reasons for our findings that raises
open questions for future studies (Section 5).
5. A proposal, based on the identified gaps of the existing
approaches, of a research agenda with the challenges that must
be met to offer practical support to the strategic alignment of
SPI (Section 6).</p>

      <title>2. Background</title>
      <p>The objectives of the processes of an organization depend on
the business goals, needs, and constraints. Hence, a process
improvement initiative must focus on the overall organization
objectives. In this section, we place SPI in the context of information
technology governance, present concepts about the dynamic of
strategic management and decision-making processes, and review
strategies for selecting and implementing an SPI initiative. These
concepts are important for understanding our criteria used for the
data-extraction design (presented in Section 3) and the attributes
for rigor and relevance assessment (described in Appendix B).</p>

        <title>Information technology (IT) governance is the system by which</title>
        <p>
          IT is directed and controlled, as defined by the ISO standard
38500:2015
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">(ISO, 2015)</xref>
          . The standard deals with IT management
in general, but it recommends the delegation of specific
responsibilities to functional managers. We extend the standard to
incorporate the role of SPI manager, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The figure,
adapted from the ISO standard, shows how the SPI managers
interact with the governance body of the organization and highlights
the important variables of the SPI governance, which are:
1. two primary stakeholders: directors and SPI managers;
2. business needs and pressures; and
3. three main tasks: Evaluate, Direct, and Monitor.
        </p>
        <p>The directors are the people who are accountable for the
performance and conformance of the organization. In a software
organization, the role of director is performed by its owners or senior
managers. The directors make decisions assisted by SPI managers,
who are experts in software processes and are aware of the
business goals. For an SPI initiative to be successful, the directors and
SPI managers must work together to align the SPI initiative with
the business goals.</p>
        <p>The business pressures and needs are important variables
because of their impact on business processes, projects and products.
In fact, the SPI goals can be derived from the business pressures
(e.g., via customer relationship management), or from the business
needs (e.g., via project goals and software product requirements).
An organization must also consider the business needs to establish
and maintain its competitive advantage.</p>
        <p>In the evaluate task, the directors need to consider pressures
that are acting upon the business, such as technological issues,
economic trends, and social or political influences for the
evaluation of current and future use of IT. In the direct task, the
directors promulgate policies and strategic goals and assign the tasks
for the design and implementation of the SPI plan. The SPI
managers provide to the directors the performance data collected from
the measurement systems. As the directors are accountable for the
SPI results, they monitor the SPI performance to ensure that the SPI
is following the business objectives.</p>
        <p>
          The two primary stakeholders presented by the ISO 38500:2015
have a straight relationship with the roles of governance and
management presented in one of the five principles of the COBIT
governance model
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">(ISACA, 2012)</xref>
          . The COBIT principle “Separating
Governance From Management” defines governance as a discipline that
establishes enterprise objectives, sets direction through
prioritization, and monitors performance and compliance against
objectives. On the other hand, management is defined as a discipline
responsible for planning, executing and monitoring activities in
alignment with the direction set by the governance body. These
two roles define two levels of decision with distinct concerns:
the strategic and the tactical. The strategic level needs to respond
quickly to external changes, while the tactical level needs to
analyze what should be done to meet the established strategic
objectives.
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">Mintzberg (1994)</xref>
          considers this subtle difference of
perspective between strategic and tactical levels a challenge for the
alignment of the strategic goals with the tactical plans.

        <p>
          The strategy has its origins in the military and its
epistemological origin defines it as “the art of the general” and the general
is a person who defines and controls objectives to be pursued by
an army, i.e., who evaluate the situation, direct by objectives and
monitor the performance of implementations of tactics. The
tactics are the means to achieve strategic objectives through
operational actions
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">(Luecke, 2005)</xref>
          . The theory of strategic planning was
incorporated into business administration by
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">Ansoff (1965)</xref>
          .
Strategic planning is a process that allows repetition of actions that
contribute to the success of organizations or, at least, avoid failures.
Strategic planning defines goals and plans based on the analysis of
Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT)
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref59">(Pickton
and Wright, 1998)</xref>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref58">Pettigrew (1987)</xref>
          presented three necessary dimensions to
develop, change, and implement strategic plans: context, content, and
process (Fig. 2). Developing a new strategy entails managing its
context and process. The context dimension establishes the reason
for an organization to engage in process improvement (why). The
outer context refers to the environment in which the organization
operates, whereas the inner context refers to the structure,
organizational culture, and political context within the company that the
strategy has to be implemented. The content dimension relates to
the organizational aspects that need to be changed (what) and the
process dimension refers to the actions and interactions with
various stakeholders as they intend to improve the organization (how).
        </p>
        <p>
          Strategic planning through the SWOT analysis
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref59">(Pickton and
Wright, 1998)</xref>
          works on the inner and outer contexts of the
Pettigrew’s framework. The analysis of the inner context examines
two characteristics of each organization: its strengths and its
weaknesses. The analysis of the outer context harnesses opportunities
to take advantage of the situation in which the organization
operates and to mitigate threats that can jeopardize actions in the
future. Besides the SWOT analysis,
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">Hussey (1997)</xref>
          describes other
techniques for strategic analysis of an organization and for
defining the strategic objectives. However, unsuccessful
implementations of planned strategies demonstrate the difficulty in enactment
and maintenance of programs arising from strategic planning, as
pointed by
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">Kaplan and Norton (2008)</xref>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          According to
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">Mintzberg (1994)</xref>
          , the success of a strategy is not
limited to the plan, so the research on strategic planning should
focus on the control and management of the strategy. After all, in
any business sector, dynamics of actions bring desired and
undesired (but necessary) changes in strategy. Planned programs fail to
represent strategic value because new options emerge throughout
their execution, offering what Mintzberg and Waters
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">(Mintzberg
and Waters, 1985)</xref>
          call “emergent strategy”, which is illustrated in
Fig. 3.
        </p>
        <p>
          The dynamic of strategic management implies constant
evaluation and decisions on the previously deliberated alternatives.
An emergent strategy can take the place of a deliberate
strategy, which becomes an unrealized strategy. This realignment
usually implies several costs and the waste of time because of
the changes of the actions in progress. Likewise,
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">Eisenhardt and
Zbaracki (1992)</xref>
          define a strategic decision as one that is relevant
regarding the actions to be taken, the resources needed or the
organizational context.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the context of the software organizations,
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref53">Münch et al.
(2012)</xref>
          state that software process changes are human based and
context dependent, representing significant costs for an
organization. Therefore, SPI programs have a straight relationship with the
strategic decision-making.

Humphrey’s principles,
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">McFeeley (1996)</xref>
          defines the IDEAL model
for establishing and carrying out an SPI program. In the IDEAL
model, there are two important components for software process
improvement that need to be considered: a strategic and tactical
ones. The strategic component provides directions and prioritization
of tactical activities based on the organization’s business goals and
drivers. In the IDEAL’s initiating phase, senior management must
determine the business goals and rationale for an SPI program and
establish the urgency for those programs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Generally, organizations seek to implement SPI because of
different business goals
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">(ISO, 2004)</xref>
          :
• to enhance the quality of the product;
• to minimize wasted time and effort;
• to reduce time to market; and
• to provide predictability.
        </p>
        <p>
          The mentioned above business goals direct decisions related
to process improvement programs, such as the selection of
practices to improve as well as the selection of the SPI approach to
implement the practices.
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref53">Münch et al. (2012)</xref>
          define two SPI
approaches: model-based SPI approaches (top-down) and continuous
SPI approaches (bottom-up). The model-based approaches compare
organizational processes with a reference model and uses an SPI
assessment to identify gaps and potential improvement options.
Examples of model-based SPI approaches are CMMI
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">(Chrissis et al.,
2011)</xref>
          and ISO 15540
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">(ISO, 2004)</xref>
          . The continuous SPI approaches
address specific solutions for identified problems and evaluate
specific effects of improvement programs. Münch et al. cite the
Quality Improvement Paradigm (QIP)
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">(Basili, 1989)</xref>
          and the Total
Quality Management (TQM)
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">(Martínez-Lorente et al., 1998)</xref>
          as examples
of continuous SPI approaches.
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref63">Salo and Abrahamsson (2005)</xref>
          also
present the agile SPI as a continuous SPI approach.
        </p>
        <p>
          The better the alignment between business objectives and
process improvement decisions, the greater the likelihood of success
of the SPI program
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">(ISO, 2013)</xref>
          . Although some proposed SPI
approaches point out the importance of business alignment of SPI
programs, as far as we know, none describes how to obtain such
alignment.
        </p>
        <p>
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref68">Trienekens et al. (2005)</xref>
          emphasize the central role of the
decision-making process for decomposing business strategy and
goals into process and team goals. They present a three-level
decision: strategic (Why), tactical (What), and operational (How). The
strategic decision is related to the prioritization of business goals.
The SPI managers are faced with the tactical decisions when they
have to select one SPI alternative that better aligns with the
strategic decisions made by the directors. The operational decision is
related to the choice of tools, procedures, and templates used to
support the implementation of an SPI program.

      <sec id="sec-4-1">
        <title>I. Planning the review:</title>
        <p>• Specification of research questions; and
• Development of the search strategy.</p>
        <p>II. Conducting the review:
• Database search and definition of the snowballing start set;
• Execution of snowballing and data extraction;
• Evaluation of the protocol;
• Rigor-relevance assessment of empirical studies; and
• Synthesis and discussion of issues.</p>
        <p>III. Reporting the review.</p>
        <sec id="sec-4-1-1">
          <title>3.1. Research questions</title>
          <p>The overall objective of our systematic literature review is to
identify approaches to strategic alignment of software process
improvement to obtain a more detailed and comprehensive view on
the topic. Furthermore, we seek for usage evidence to assess
empirical studies through rigor and relevance.</p>
          <p>The Research Questions (RQ) are defined as:</p>
        </sec>
      </sec>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-5">
      <title>RQ 1. What are the available approaches to strategic alignment of SPI?</title>
      <p>RQ 1.1. For each identified approach, is there a method or
procedure for dynamic realignment of SPI initiatives in the case
of changing business goals (emergent strategies)?
RQ 1.2. For each identified approach, is there a systematic
method or procedure to support decision making on both
levels (strategic and tactical)?</p>

        <title>3.2. The search strategy</title>
        <p>The following steps are executed to answer the research
questions:
1. Database search and extraction of studies using search strings.
2. Duplicate elimination.
3. Dataset filter by title, keywords, and abstract analysis using
inclusion-exclusion criteria.
4. Snowballing search that applies both types of snowball:
Backward Snowball (BSB) consisting of scanning the reference
list of each study.</p>
        <p>Forward Snowball (FSB) consisting of the selection of citations
retrieved by Google Scholar.
5. Snowballing filter, study classification and data extraction.
6. Protocol evaluation that measure search sensitivity and
precision.
7. Rigor-relevance assessment of empirical studies.
8. Synthesis.</p>

          Fig. 4 shows the workflow with all the steps described above,
including Quality Assurance (QA) activities to deal with the
possible threats to the validity of this research. Each QAx activity is
described later in this section. As recommended by
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">Kitchenham and
Brereton (2013)</xref>
          , we use a dataset of known studies, called Initial
Quasi-Gold Standard (Initial QGS), to define the search string. We
also use our Final dataset to evaluate our protocol execution.

        <title>3.2.1. Database search, duplicate elimination and database filtering</title>
        <p>
          We use the PICOC criteria (Population, Intervention,
Comparison, Outcome and Context)
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33 ref57 ref8">(Kitchenham and Charters, 2007;
Petticrew and Roberts, 2006)</xref>
          and ten already known studies as the
Initial QGS
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35 ref72">(Zhang et al., 2011; Kitchenham et al., 2011)</xref>
          to select
keywords and to compose the search string. However, we do not
include the “Comparison” part of the PICOC because the main
objective of this literature review is not to retrieve evidence of
comparison among approaches. The PICOC criteria derive keywords as
following:
• Population: Software Process Improvement initiatives
• Intervention: Strategic (OR Business goal) AND alignment
        </p>
      </sec>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-7">
      <title>AND approach</title>
      <p>• Comparison: not included
• Outcomes: Business oriented SPI
• Context: any</p>
      <p>
        The string derived from the PICOC criteria is refined with
identified synonyms and alternative spellings
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">(Kitchenham and
Brereton, 2013)</xref>
        through a series of pilot searches (Fig. 5). A trade-off
between sensitivity (also known as recall
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">(Manning et al., 2008)</xref>
        )
and precision
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23 ref72">(Higgins and Green, 2011; Zhang et al., 2011)</xref>
        is
expected. Sensitivity is defined as the number of identified relevant
reports divided by the total number of existing relevant reports
and precision is defined as the number of identified relevant
reports divided by the total number of identified reports. Increasing
the sensitivity of a search reduces its precision and retrieves more
non-relevant primary studies
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23 ref35">(Higgins and Green, 2011;
Kitchenham et al., 2011)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>We do not use the keyword “initiatives” nor the SPI acronym
because it only decreases precision without an increase of the
sensitivity value. In our protocol, the only purpose of the String
refinement and Database search step (Step 1 in Fig. 4) is to establish the
start set for the Snowballing search step. As we do not expect high
precision in this initial search, the String refinement and Database
search step ends when the search reaches a 70% of sensitivity and
1.4% of precision values as illustrated in Fig. 5. A better precision
value is later expected with our snowballing complementary
strategy.</p>

      <p>The IEEE Xplore Advanced Search returned more than two
million studies with the default string search. We adapted the default
string for the IEEE Xplore due to the lack of precision showed. The
decrease of the sensitivity caused by this adaptation does not
configure a problem because 100% of sensitivity is expected because
of our snowballing complementary strategy.</p>
      <p>The String adapted for IEEE Xplore:
((“software process improvement”) AND (“business goal”) AND
(“alignment” OR “in line with”) AND (“method” OR “approach”))</p>
      <p>The following list of known papers is used as the Initial
QuasiGold Standard:</p>
      <p>The database search retrieved seven of the 10 QGS studies (70%
sensitivity previously mentioned). The QGS I, III, and X were not
retrieved and we proceed to the next protocol step. As mentioned,
100% of sensitivity is expected after the snowballing procedures
(Table 1).</p>
      <p>The search for primary studies is based on these reference
databases: Springer, Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct,
Compendex, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library. The database search
was conducted in August 2015, without any set limits
regarding publication year. In July 2016, we performed the
Snowballingsearch step (Step 4 in Fig. 4)again using the Final dataset as the
start set to confirm or update the research data. But, the
snowballing search did not return any new study. The following lists of
URLs and command types were used:

        The Database search and the Duplicate elimination steps build
the Initial dataset (I). Exclusions done by applying exclusion
criteria results in the Filtered dataset (A), which constituted the start
set
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref71">(Wohlin, 2014)</xref>
        used to spot more relevant papers by
snowballing. An independent researcher reviews the string usage and
the search results, therefore representing the execution of QA1.

      <sec id="sec-7-1">
        <title>3.2.2. Inclusion-exclusion criteria</title>
        <p>The first author formulated the inclusion-exclusion criteria that
are reviewed for validation by the other authors in the Planning
stage. Studies are included in the dataset only if they receive a
positive answer to any of the following questions:
• Does the paper discuss SPI and business alignment approaches?
• Does the paper contain evidence of SPI and business
alignment?
• Does the paper discuss a particular case of SPI and business
alignment?</p>
        <p>Subsequently, exclusion criteria are applied excluding papers
that:
• are not primary studies;
• are not in English;
• are related to business process improvement or IT alignment in
general but not to SPI alignment in particular; or
• are related to SPI but not discuss a business alignment
approach. Some studies may offer a measurement approach to SPI,
emphasizing its potential use for business alignment, but they
are excluded if do not present an alignment procedure.</p>
        <p>
          The first and the third authors applied the rule presented by
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">Badampudi et al. (2015)</xref>
          for the inclusion-exclusion decision
process. The rule states that paper is included if either one of the
authors accepts it. An invited researcher reviews the performed
inclusion-exclusion checking in a random sampling if the
mentioned criteria were proper applied. This independent audit
represents the execution of QA2.

        <title>3.2.3. Snowballing search</title>
        <p>The snowballing search strategy becomes significant when a
string refinement attempt meets with difficulties due to the lack
of standardized keywords. This difficulty is related to the research
topic and has an impact in the trade-off analysis between
sensitivity and precision of the search.</p>
        <p>
          Unlike the guidelines proposed by
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref71">Wohlin (2014)</xref>
          , a broader
database search is planned to establish the start set of papers
for the snowballing search. Our protocol does not use the Google
Scholar for the start set definition because of its lower precision,
possibly caused by gray literature retrieval.
        </p>
        <p>Snowballing is iterative and executed until no new papers
are found, generating the Post-snowballing dataset (B). Backward
snowballing (BSB) and Forward snowballing (FSB) are executed in
two stages. The first stage (BSB) uses the inclusion-exclusion
criteria basing the decision on a review of:</p>
        <sec id="sec-7-2-1">
          <title>1. The title of the referenced paper; 2. The reference context in the paper (reading the text where the reference is cited for context evaluation); and 3. The abstract of the referenced paper.</title>
          <p>In the second stage (FSB) a search is carried out in Google
Scholar for each study. The inclusion of citing studies obeys the
following method:</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec-7-2-2">
          <title>1. The title of the citing paper is analyzed.</title>
          <p>2. The abstract of the citing paper is reviewed.
3. If the items above are not sufficient, the full text is examined.</p>
          <p>The studies included in each iteration are added to the dataset
and snowballing (BSB and FSB) of the added studies is executed
subsequently and iteratively. This procedure is followed until no
new studies are found, thus closing the Post-snowballing dataset
(B).</p>

      <sec id="sec-7-3">
        <title>3.2.4. Snowballing filtering and data extraction strategy</title>
        <p>Step 5 aims to apply inclusion-exclusion criteria to papers in
dataset B thus providing the Final dataset (C). Subsequently, the
data needed to respond the research questions are extracted and
empirical studies are identified. A full-text analysis is carried out to
confirm the inclusion of each study and to extract data
concomitantly. The inclusion-exclusion confirmation by a full-text
analysis is necessary since there can be false positive inclusions in
step 4, i.e. studies which attended the inclusion criteria by
title/abstract/keywords analysis but have to be excluded from a
fulltext analysis.</p>
        <p>Snowballing procedures are performed even for the false
positives because, although excluded, those studies can bring good
references. In our search, a recently published book by Basili et al.
(see S.39 in Appendix A) was found through a false positive study
(S.16) FSB. As further illustrated by the citation graph, this book
could only be found in our search through snowballing false
positive studies.</p>

        <p>III. Dynamic realignment method. The method or procedure for an
alignment revision in the event of changes of business goals.
IV. Decision-making method. The method or procedure supporting
the decision-making process carried out in business goal

subsequently inspected by the second and the third authors,
representing the quality assurance activities QA3 (concerning the

          Two independent researchers were asked to review the
protocol. The protocol establishes the usage of questions, presented by
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">Kitchenham and Charters (2007)</xref>

          Another action planned for protocol evaluation is checking the
sensitivity and precision values of the Final dataset against the

          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref72">Zhang et al.
(2011)</xref>
          . This search process effectiveness evaluation is also
recommended by
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">Kitchenham and Brereton (2013)</xref>

        <p>
          A checklist adapted from the work of
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">Ivarsson and Gorschek
(2010)</xref>
          is planned to assess rigor and relevance of the Final dataset
empirical studies. The checklist adaptation was carried out by the
first author defining specific criteria related to this literature
review (see Appendix B). The criteria were validated in the Planning
stage by the other authors to minimize subjectivity. Moreover, the
first and the second authors rated the studies independently for
quality assurance. The second author’s ratings aim to measure the
inter-observer agreement kappa index for a criteria refinement and
for a final agreement evaluation (Fig. 6), representing the QA6
activity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The QA6 activity consists of two double-ratings carried out
independently by two researchers. The initial double-rating aims to
establish if a criteria refinement has to be performed. A
criteria refinement must be performed only if the kappa value
represents a strength of agreement classified as less than Moderate,
i.e., is inferior to 0.41 according to
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">Landis and Koch (1977)</xref>
          . If the
strength of agreement measured after this initial rating is
classified as Moderate or higher, no criteria refinement is planned, and
the obtained kappa value is the Final Kappa index. In our case,
the refinement was necessary due to different interpretation of
the Rigor-Context and the Relevance-User/Subject attributes (see
Appendix B). The category Rigor was improved by adding the
contextual aspects proposed by
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">Petersen and Wohlin (2009)</xref>
          , whereas
the category Relevance was improved by establishing the inclusion
of software organization managers and SPI professionals as the
intended users of the approach. The second double-rating aims to
evaluate the rigor-relevance assessment process through another
strength of agreement measurement (Final Kappa in Fig. 6). Even
if the obtained kappa value represents a strength of agreement
classified as less than Moderate, no criteria refinement is planned.
This second kappa value becomes the Final Kappa index. The Final
Kappa is a quality index aiming to evaluate a researcher bias in the
rigor-relevance assessment step.

retrieved approaches. Almost all approaches describe procedures
starting with business goals that have already been defined (e.g.
goals stated by existing strategic plans). Nevertheless, they do not
deal with the prioritization issue. The process for selecting SPI
alternatives (tactical decision-making) is partially supported by a
systematic method in Karlström approach (S.27). This study uses
the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) proposed by

rating certain factors affecting a process improvement goal.
However, SPI decisions are not taken as a result of this method because
the ratings are applied only for rank factors that influence goals
and not for selecting SPI alternatives.

        <title>4.6. Answers to research questions</title>
        <p>The Final dataset (Table 5) answers the research question 1,
which deals with the availability of approaches. We classified
the 19 approaches we found as theoretical or empirical. The
GQM+Strategies’ book partially address a realignment solution (RQ
1.1) although it does not provide a procedure and an evidence of
use of the realignment. Concerning the availability of methods for
decision-making support (RQ 1.2), only one approach presents a
systematic method supporting part of the tactical decision-making.
However, the AHP usage in Karlström approach does not answer
the research question RQ 1.2 positively because it does not address
the selection among SPI alternatives. Table 5 also answers the
research question about the empirical evidence of the retrieved
approaches (RQ 2). The table shows that 13 approaches present 18
empirical studies, while the other 6 approaches only present
theoretical studies. The results of the empirical studies’ assessment
(presented in Table 6) answer the research questions about the
quality of the evidence (RQ 2.1, and RQ 2.2). In Section 5, we
discuss these results in more detail and conjecture about possible
causes for the findings.</p>

      <sec id="sec-8-9">
        <title>4.6.1. Approaches and citation graph</title>
        <p>Fig. 7 illustrates the study distribution by year, also given in
Table 5.</p>
        <p>The concentration of studies between 2007 and 2011 clearly
stands out. Three seminal theoretical studies of GQM+Strategies
were published in 2007. The highest concentration of studies
was in 2010, with the largest number of new proposed
approaches (RSM, BOQM, Barreto, and SCOPE). The eight studies
describe six approaches. Both theoretical RSM studies (S.34 and
S.35) are very similar. BOQM, Barreto and SCOPE approaches, along
with a GQM+Strategies study (S.49) are empirical studies. Another
GQM+Strategies study (S.49), as well as a Sun and Liu study (S.30),
are theoretical complements of previously published approaches.
The two most recent approaches (Plösch and SBPA) were published
in 2011 along with another GQM+Strategies empirical study (S.5).
Only two empirical studies of GQM+Strategies (S.39 and S.40) were
published after 2011 indicating a discontinuity of research on this
topic. The empirical study described in the GQM+Strategies’ book
(published in 2014) is quite similar to the case study presented
in the S.49 study (published in 2010). AE-MPS (S.3 and S.19) and
TNNL studies (S.17 and S.48) also describe a similar evidence.</p>
        <p>The Final dataset brings 19 approaches in which only 13 have
empirical evidence because Reiblein (S.15), McCoy (S.37), Waina
(S.1), Sun and Liu (S.30 and S.36), and RSM (S.34 and S.35) are only
theoretical proposals. Fig. 8 shows the citation graph representing
empirical studies with a black background, theoretical studies with
a gray background, excluded studies with a white background, and
unavailable studies with a dotted line and a white background. A
dashed box marks a group of studies related to the same approach.
Asterisks mark each Initial QGS dataset study.</p>
        <p>The GQM+Strategies showed a significant number of citations;
nevertheless, only two cited by other approaches of interest (S.9
and S.42). The S.9 theoretical study was cited by 11 other studies
although only by one another approach (BOQM - S.8). Despite the
study being published three years after the first appearance of the
approach, this high citation level could be explained due to the
high degree of impact of the vehicle used (IEEE Computer).</p>
        <p>Snowballing fully recovered the studies of the Initial QGS
dataset, which accounted for nine different approaches. The degree
of influence, represented by the number of times another has cited
an approach, is illustrated by direct edges in Fig. 8.</p>
        <p>Table 7 shows the 19 retrieved approaches, chronologically
ordered by the oldest included study, and indicates their degree of
influence. Earlier approaches had been expected to have an
influence on more recent ones; however, the graph showed a very
small number of citations also indicating little comparison among
approaches.</p>
        <p>AE-MPS was the most influential approach with study S.19 cited
by Sun and Liu (S.30), Barreto (S.6) and SCOPE (S.31), but this
result is nevertheless misleading due to the weak connectivity
illustrated by the citation graph. Although the previously presented
graph shows strongly connected subgraph, it represents an
intraapproach connection (see the group GQM+Strategies in Fig. 8).</p>

        <title>4.6.2. Rigor-relevance assessment results - study distribution</title>
        <p>
          The rigor and relevance ratings are used to answer research
question RQ2. As presented by
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54">Munir et al. (2015)</xref>
          , studies are
distributed by the rigor and relevance scores into four quadrants (A,
B, C and D).
        </p>
        <p>The following rationale did the classification:
• Studies with scores from 0 to 1.5 are classified as low rigor
since high rigor is defined for a score of 2 or higher.
• Studies with scores from 0 to 2 are classified as low relevance
since high relevance covers score of 3 or 4.</p>
        <p>The quadrants visualized in Fig. 9 represented the four possible
combinations:</p>
        <sec id="sec-8-10-1">
          <title>A. High rigor and high relevance; B. High rigor and low relevance; C. Low rigor and high relevance; and D. Low rigor and low relevance.</title>
          <p>1.4
31.8
19.6
33.3</p>
          <p>Only three studies were found to have the highest rigor and
relevance grades (see area A in Fig. 9). No study was classified in the
B category (high rigor and low relevance). Moreover, eight studies
were ranked in the C category (high relevance but low rigor) and
seven studies in the D category (low relevance and low rigor). S.27
(Karlström approach) was the best-rated study. It was retrieved by
snowballing and did not present any influence on other approaches
despite its age (13 years).</p>
        </sec>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-8-11">
        <title>4.7. Protocol evaluation</title>
        <p>The Final dataset was used to evaluate the protocol as
established in our protocol (see Step 6 in Fig. 4). Sensitivity and
precision values were calculated based on the Initial QGS and Final
datasets. The Final dataset presents 20 new studies to the
Initial QGS dataset, eight retrieved by the database search and 12 by
snowballing. Table 8 represents the evolution of the sensitivity and
precision values relating to the Initial QGS dataset and Table 9
illustrates the evolution of the sensitivity and precision values
relating to the Final dataset.</p>
        <p>The sensitivity of the database search decreased when
considering the Final dataset. A better string refinement would have to
be done to increase sensitivity if using only database search. As
a result, the string should become more comprehensive and
complex, considerably decreasing the precision. Low precision implies
lower efficiency due to the nonlinear increase of false positives;
therefore, it can be concluded that snowballing contributed to the
protocol efficiency.</p>
        <p>Conversely, the precision could not reach 100% only snowballing
the Initial QGS dataset. Seven studies (S.1, S.10, S.13, S.15, S.18, S.21,
and S.27) would not be retrieved if we used the Initial QGS dataset
as a snowballing start set. The use of the database search to
configure the snowballing start set made possible the recovery of these
studies. The citation graph (see Fig. 8) illustrates this by the
subgraphs analysis. Subgraphs without an Initial QGS study (indicated
by an asterisk) as a vertex, would not be retrieved. We observed
that the same 100% precision could be obtained by applying the
database search step only on ACM, IEEE and SCOPUS, reducing the
Initial dataset to 158 studies, therefore increasing the protocol
efficiency. Nevertheless, it would be unknown which database to
disregard a priori because the Duplicate elimination step did not
show any unnecessary databases as each contributed to at least
one unique study. The decrease of the precision in the evolution
from the dataset A (Filtered) to dataset B (Post-snowballing) always
occurs due to false positives insertions. But the analyses based on
the Final dataset (see Table 9) shows the contribution of the
snowballing to the efficiency of the search. The snowballing decreased
the precision value only 9.4 percentage points (68.2–58.8%) and
increased the sensitivity 50 percentage points (50–100%).</p>

      <title>5. Discussions and threats to validity</title>
      <p>The results of our SLR confirmed our conjecture that there is
insufficient evidence of the validation of the proposed approaches
to the strategic alignment of SPI and brought up some open
questions, contributing to a proposal of a future research agenda. In
this section, we discuss our findings and the limitations of our SLR
because of possible biases.</p>

        <title>5.1.1. No new proposals since 2011</title>
        <p>
          Our investigation to answer the research question 1 (RQ 1)
resulted in 19 approaches to the strategic alignment of SPI. As we
can see in Table 5, there was a significant number of proposals
from 1997 until 2011, but, surprisingly, no new proposal since then.
This last finding was unexpected. Our perception is that
practitioners still have no support for the alignment of the SPI with the
business goals by a proper technology transfer
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">(Gorschek et al.,
2006)</xref>
          , yet the scientific community has silenced about the
problem. A conjecture is that the popularity of the SPI area itself has
decreased, affecting the continuity of research in any topic related
to this field. However,
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">Kuhrmann et al. (2016)</xref>
          contradict this
conjecture by a mapping study in which they show that the number of
studies published annually has increased for the past 20 years. We
also refute the conjecture and argue that the continuous evolution
of technology implies in new practices of software development
and, consequently, in new SPI initiatives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another possibility is that the alignment of SPI with business
goals is not a research-worthy problem because the published
approaches have already solved it. For a problem to be considered
solved, it requires a validated approach. The validation of candidate
solutions has three steps in the technology transfer model
proposed by
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">Gorschek et al. (2006)</xref>
          and later summarized in
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">Gorschek
(2015)</xref>
          . The first step involves an academic validation to test the
proposed solution and to get feedback for improvements.
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">Gorschek
et al. (2006)</xref>
          argue that a solution validation is not complete if it
is carried out only in an academic setting. We agree with them
and penalize the empirical studies carried out only in academic
environments (e.g., in laboratory trials) by decreasing their score
in the attribute Relevance-Research Method (see Appendix B). The
two subsequent steps (static and dynamic validations) occur in the
industry. The static validation involves training of the practitioners
and support by the solution proponents throughout the evaluation
of the solution. The dynamic validation consists in handing over the
solution to the industry without any interference of the solution
proponents. Only eight of 18 empirical studies assessed describe a
static validation, and none of the evaluated studies presents a
dynamic validation. Therefore, we can conclude that the alignment
of SPI with business goals is not a problem solved by the proposed
approaches.

        <p>
          Other probable causes for the lack of new proposals can be
the challenges on university–industry collaborations mentioned by

          present a list of challenges of a
university–industry collaboration in programs involving software
engineering empirical studies. Dealing with conflicting interests of
researchers and company managers, establishing adequate
experimental controls, and choosing the appropriate metrics are
examples of challenges in these initiatives. The conflict of interests in
this type of research is usually related to the requirements of data
confidentiality (i.e., Non-Disclosure Agreements), different
definitions of success, different perceptions of the problem, and different
perspectives of commitment to the project. Research may be
jeopardized or its results not be published if these conflicts are not
negotiated or previously determined by either party.

and separate this problem into two groups: “lost in translation”
and “lost before translation”. The former relates to the synthesis
quality of the studies, which is directly linked to our findings of
low rigor values of the assessed studies. The later refers to the
production difficulty associated to the challenges in the
universityindustry collaboration aforementioned. The scarcity of new
proposals might be a consequence of the perceived risks related to these
two groups of problems.

        <p>
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref66">Starkey and Madan (2001)</xref>
          state that developing an

developping researchers in single disciplines. Indeed,
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">Lethbridge et al.

          point that software engineering researchers are generally
not trained in management. This lack of expertise might keep
researchers away from the management issues related to SPI,
preventing them from developing new approaches to strategic
alignment of SPI.
        </p>
        <p>To conclude, our results show that the interest in strategic
alignment of SPI decreased without a consistent and practical
approach to achieving such alignment.</p>

        <title>5.1.2. Lack of methods for realignment and decision-making support</title>
        <p>
          The lack of a realignment method in the evaluated approaches
(see Section 4.3.1) indicates that the realignment remains an open
issue, answering, therefore, the research question 1.1 (RQ 1.1). The
use of the evaluated approaches, in situations that require a
review of the SPI actions in progress, needs to be addressed by new
empirical studies. Static implementations, i.e., considering a frozen
business analysis, are not relevant because a complete solution
should address the emergent strategies defined by
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">Mintzberg and
Waters (1985)</xref>
          . In fact, a change of business objectives and the
revision of the established improvement plans involve decisions about
reallocation of resources and redefinition of priorities that must be
supported by a realignment method. Regardless of the difficulty
that realignment represents, it is a research challenge that must
be met to offer practical support for the strategic alignment of SPI.
        </p>
        <p>Another finding is the lack of a method for decision-making
support in the existing approaches which answers the research
question 1.2 (RQ 1.2). As mentioned in Section 4.3.2, only one of
the 19 approaches presents a systematic support of decision
making partially used in the strategic alignment of SPI. Even though
the strategic alignment of SPI is a decision-making problem, no
other study describes how to make decisions in this process. We
argue that there could be two main reasons for this lacuna: the
interdisciplinarity challenge and the decision-making paradox.</p>
        <p>
          The first reason is again related to the lack of complementary
expertise necessary in this type of research. Decision-making is a
subject of other disciplines, such as operations research,
psychology, economics, and cognitive science.
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">March (1991)</xref>
          points that
developing a theory of decision-making in organizations can be
supported by different perspectives. Each of the above disciplines
deals with a particular view of the problem, and the researcher
needs to know which theory has to be applied in the context and
to the problem under investigation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other reason for the lack of decision-making methods in
the studies about the strategic alignment of SPI can be the
challenge of deciding on the best decision-making method, also known
as the decision-making paradox.
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref67">Triantaphyllou and Mann (1989)</xref>
          discuss the comparative value of four multi-criteria
decisionmaking (MCDM) methods to establish this paradox. The
conclusion of their study is that the four methods yield different results
even when they are fed with the same data and decision
problem. Moreover,
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">Montibeller and Franco (2010)</xref>
          argue that MCDM
has limitations that may interfere with its use for supporting a
strategic decision process, claiming that changes to MCDM
methods require the consideration of other technical and social aspects.
        </p>
        <p>
          An MCDM method works in the analysis of a finite set of
alternatives that are evaluated regarding well-defined criteria,
indicating a well-structured problem. Nevertheless, some decision
problems are ill-structured and occur in dynamic environments in
which time pressure and uncertainty are the norms. These
situations demand another type of decision-making support and
motivate the naturalistic decision-making (NDM) research. Moreover,
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">Klein (2008)</xref>
          argues that decision support systems developed by
formal methods do not improve decision quality. In contrast, the
NDM researchers try to discover how people decide instead of
using a formal model of decision making.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regarding SPI,
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">Moe et al. (2012)</xref>
          state that moving from a
plandriven to an agile development can be seen as moving from
rational to naturalistic decision-making, showing the need for more
empirical studies of NDM in agile development. Indeed, the agility
expected in the tactical decisions (the selection of practices to
improve) seems to deal with a naturalistic decision while a formal
decision-making process still shows suitability to the strategic
decisions (the prioritization of organizational goals). We argue that
the institutionalization of agile practices is not a problem for NDM
and an SPI program, even in an agile environment, still demands
an MCDM method.

        <title>5.1.3. Empirical studies scarcity and low rigor and relevance values</title>
        <p>Our SLR results reinforce the need to close the gap between
research and practice, as six out of 19, or 31.6%, retrieved approaches
are only theoretical proposals. The other 13 approaches present 18
empirical studies (See Table 5), answering the research question 2
(RQ 2). But, three approaches report the same evidence twice –
AE-MPS (S.3 and S.19), GQM+Strategies (S.39 and S.49), and TNNL
(S.17 and S.48). Even if the reports are complementary in some
way, the execution context of the approach is the same. This
duplicity reduces our empirical sampling to only 15 contexts of use
offered by 13 approaches, in which only the GQM+Strategies
approach presents more than one context of use. It is an insufficient
sample to transfer any solution to practice properly.</p>
        <p>In addition to the scarcity of the evidence, the results of the
Rigor-Relevance assessment showed a low rigor average (1.4 in a
0–3 scale), which answers the research question 2.1 (RQ 2.1). The
low rigor evaluation was mainly a consequence of the attributes
Rigor-Design and the Rigor-Validity threat. Despite the description
of the threats to validity be important to ensure the reliability of
an empirical study and to contribute to the understanding of the
challenges related to the use of an approach, only one out of the
18 empirical studies details the limitations of its research.
Regarding the Design attribute, only two out of the 18 empirical studies
completely describe their design and nine out of the 18 studies
provide an incomplete description of the design. The other seven
empirical studies do not describe their designs. The lack of proper
measured variables and measurement criteria are the most
common perceived flaws. It could be argued that it is difficult to
determine an outcome of an approach to the strategic alignment of
SPI. An SPI program demands time, and its long-term results could
present many confounding variables that it becomes often
impossible to measure the consequences of the decisions properly.
However, the focus of a validation of such type of approach should be
the decision-making process instead of the decisions’ outcomes.
Indeed, like any other strategic planning, it is often impossible to
determine a cause-effect relationship between the decision-making
process with the results of the implementation of the action plans,
but an assessment of how much an approach could assist the
decision-making process could be valuable.</p>
        <p>Finally, the relevance average of 2.5 in a 0–4 scale (See Table 6)
answers the research question 2.2 (RQ 2.2). This low average
resulted from a lack of details of the descriptions related to the
attributes Scale and Research Method. As we will explain later, this
lack is a threat to the validity of our results because half of the
evaluated studies do not clearly report the research method and
the scale of the sample of the research. Our criteria penalize such
lack of description because it hinders the understanding of the
empirical studies, hence compromising their validation.</p>

          were considered to minimize researchers’ bias and to ensure the
reliability of this SLR. The internal dimension of a study’s validity
represents how well the study answers its research questions and
the bias degree of the study. The external validity, on the other
hand, is related to the generalizability or applicability of a study’s
findings.

        <p>
          This study’s internal validity was strengthened by a protocol
designed with verifiable procedures that are based on well-known
systematic review guidelines and recommendations
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23 ref32 ref33 ref55 ref71 ref8">(Wohlin, 2014;

et al., 2015; Kitchenham and Brereton, 2013)</xref>
          as well on guidelines
for quality assessment criteria
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">(Ivarsson and Gorschek, 2010)</xref>
          .
        </p>
        <p>To mitigate the selection bias, we designed a search strategy
that defined the research terms and the inclusion-exclusion
criteria. The search string was refined before the execution of the
search, as shown in Fig. 5, to ensure that the selection process
was as comprehensive and unbiased as possible. The search
strategy was developed by the first author and reviewed by the others.
Additionally, the results of the database search were checked by
the use of the string in a parallel search carried out by an invited
researcher. Finally, two invited researchers evaluated the
inclusionexclusion criteria applied to the initial dataset. They performed this
quality assurance activity independently and reviewed 129 of the
495 studies. Their decisions about the inclusion or exclusion of a
study were the same as those reached by the first author.</p>
        <p>
          Another threat to validity refers to the existence of potential
confounding factors, i.e., whether the results of a study are really
based on the collected data
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">(Easterbrook et al., 2008)</xref>
          . The lack of
a standard terminology on the subject was an important concern
in this study. A string refinement was carried out supported by the
PICOC criteria and the Initial QGS dataset. The Initial QGS dataset
was also used for the search performance evaluation through the
measurement of sensitivity and precision of the search. Moreover,
the data properties and relationship with the research questions
were established to address data extraction accuracy (see Table 2),
enabling the agreement in the classification of the studies. The
other authors later reviewed this data-extraction strategy proposed
by the first author.
        </p>
        <p>Regarding the search and the selection of studies, we combined
the snowballing and database search strategies to balance the
sensitivity and precision values of our search. Seven digital libraries
were used to provide, in an unbiased manner, the start set of the
snowballing search. The snowballing was also used to mitigate the
risk of missing relevant studies. The snowballing contributed to the
reliability of our SLR because we retrieved six approaches and 50%
of the selected studies through this complementary strategy.
Moreover, the Snowballing-search and Snowballing-filter Steps (Steps 4
and 5 in Fig. 4) were performed by the first author and the results
were inspected by two other authors independently. These
qualityassurance activities (QA 3 and 4 in Fig. 4) were carried out hiding
the outcomes of each researcher to minimize their performance
bias. All questions raised by the two authors who performed the
QA activities were properly answered by the first author and no
disagreements were observed in the selection and filtering of the
studies in the snowballing steps.</p>
        <p>
          Limitations of this SLR still exist because there could be
studies (and approaches) not retrieved if they do not cite or have not
been cited by a study of our post-snowballing dataset. This risk
is related to the lack of a standard terminology on the subject
of the research questions and to the natural trade-off between
database search sensitivity and precision. Another concern about
the reliability of this SLR exists because future search replications
may yield different results due to the inconsistencies of search
engines mentioned by
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">Brereton et al. (2007)</xref>
          , affecting the
definition of the start set for the snowballing step. Moreover, the
snowballing search also presents limitations, especially in the forward
snowball (FSB), consisting of the selection of citations retrieved
by Google Scholar, due to inconsistencies of the Google Scholar.
We performed another Snowballing-search Step based on the
Final dataset before the submission of this paper (in July 2016), and
we obtained an incorrect register of a citation. The result of FSB in
Google Scholar retrieved a citation of the S.51 by the S.24 study,
but the list of references of S.24 does not include the S.51 study.
A cross-checking between the results of the FSB and BSB detected
this error.
        </p>
        <p>
          To minimize the performance bias in the Rigor-Relevance
Assessment Step, the checklist proposed by
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">Ivarsson and Gorschek
(2010)</xref>
          was extended by the first author, as described in
Section 3.2.6. The adapted criteria were validated by the other
authors. Additionally, the first and second authors rated the studies
independently for quality assurance. The initially obtained kappa
demanded a second rating that was performed after a refinement
of the assessment criteria. The Final Kappa index indicated a
“Substantial” strength of agreement of the assessment of rigor and an
“Almost Perfect” strength of agreement of the assessment of
relevance. Reaching such level of inter-observer agreement was
possible after the refinement of the assessment criteria. However, some
classification failures are conceivable because the authors had to
make inferences about some studies” content due to the lack of
information in the reports. Another threat to the validity of our SLR
is the fact that the same researchers performed the initial rating
and the second rating, hence contributing to a higher kappa value

        <title>5.2.2. Overall completeness and applicability of evidence - external validity</title>
        <p>External validity is concerned with the relevance of the
evidence. The evidence obtained and evaluated by our SLR were
relevant to answer the research questions and to confirm our
conjecture that there is insufficient evidence of the validation of the
existing approaches to the strategic alignment of SPI. We argue that
it is unlikely that our SLR missed a relevant study because it is
expected that a relevant study cites, or is cited by, another relevant
study that was retrieved. Our results are applicable to both
practitioners and researchers. The contribution of this study for a
practitioner is an overview of existing approaches to strategic alignment
of SPI. Furthermore, the identified empirical studies describe the
contexts where each approach can be applied. The contributions of
this study for researchers are summarized at the end of Section 1.</p>

      <title>6. Conclusion and future work</title>
      <p>The objectives of our systematic literature review were to
identify the available approaches to strategic alignment of SPI and
evaluate empirical studies to confirm or refute our conjecture that
there is insufficient evidence of the validation of the proposed
approaches to the strategic alignment of SPI. This SLR identified 19
approaches to the strategic alignment of SPI in 30 selected studies.
We assessed 18 empirical studies using a rigor and relevance
criteria and confirmed our conjecture because of the scarcity of
empirical studies and the low rigor values of the assessed ones. We also
found that there is no method to support the decision-making
processes in the strategic and tactical levels of a strategic alignment of
SPI. Another finding of our SLR was that none of the retrieved
approaches addresses the realignment that is necessary to react to
emergent strategies.</p>
      <p>
        The main conclusion of our study is that the lack of empirical
validation indicates that the results of the existing approaches have
not been properly transferred to practitioners yet, calling for more
rigorous studies on the subject. From the findings of this SLR, we
list the following goals that we will pursue in the near future,
• Conduct a qualitative research to collect data on the
perceived values of the formal and naturalistic approaches to the
decision-making process of strategic alignment of SPI. The NDM
research method and a constructivist approach may be
appropriate in an agile context of SPI, while the formal methods may
be more appropriate to plan-driven scenarios.
• Extend an in-progress NDM research that is investigating how
software project managers decide
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">(Cunha et al., 2016)</xref>
        to
investigate how an agile team decides on the improvement of its
software process.
• Conduct empirical studies to determine the usefulness and
usability of a formal decision-making to support the strategic
alignment of SPI, both in agile and in plan-driven scenarios.
• Compare the sensitivity and precision of our SLR search strategy
with a strategy based strictly on database search and with a
strategy based strictly on snowballing.
• Propose a new set of rigor-relevance assessment criteria
consolidate from the criteria proposed in
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">Ivarsson and Gorschek

        and
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">Martins and Gorschek
(2016)</xref>
        • Conduct a qualitative study to determine factors that can
change an SPI program because of the organizational emergent
strategies and to identify the criteria used for the realignment
decision of the SPI.

• Context (C)
I. Strong description: The context is described to the degree
where it becomes comparable to other settings. This involves
description of market and organization structure
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">(Petersen and

is mentioned or presented briefly but not described sufficiently
so that a reader can understand and compare it to another
context. C is evaluated to 0.5.</p>
      <p>III. Weak description: If no description of context is provided in the
study, then C is evaluated to 0.
• Design (D)
I. Strong description: The study design is described in enough
detail for the reader to understand. To be specific, if the study
presents measured variables, measurement criteria, treatments,
the number of subjects, and sampling, then D is evaluated to 1.
II. Medium description: If the study lacks any of the factors
related to design and data collection is missing (see above), then
D evaluates to 0.5.</p>
      <p>III. Weak description: If no design description is provided at all, D
is evaluated to 0.
• Validity threats (V)
I. Strong description: If different types of threats to validity (i.e.,
internal, external, conclusion, and construct validity) are
evaluated and reflected upon, then V is evaluated to 1.</p>
      <p>II. Medium description: If the study only highlights a subset of the
relevant threat categories or the validity is mentioned but not
described in detail, then V is evaluated to 0.5.</p>

• User/Subject (U)
I. Contribution to relevance: If the subjects used in the evaluation
are representative of the intended users of the approach, i.e.,
software organization managers and SPI professionals, then U
is evaluated to 1.</p>
      <p>II. No contribution to relevance: If the subjects used in the
evaluation are not representative of the envisioned approach users,

• Context (C)
• Scale (S)
I. Contribution to relevance: If the evaluation is performed in a
setting representative of the intended usage, i.e., industrial
setting, then C is evaluated to 1.</p>
      <p>II. No contribution to relevance: If the evaluation is performed in
a laboratory or other settings not representative of a real usage,
then C is evaluated to 0.</p>
      <p>I. Contribution to relevance: If the scale of the applications used
in the evaluation is of realistic size, i.e., it covers the whole
organizational unit, then S is evaluated to 1.</p>
      <p>II. No contribution to relevance: If the evaluation is performed
in a simulation or using applications of unrealistic size (e.g., a
project), then S is evaluated to 0.
• Research Method (RM)
I. Contribution to relevance: If the research method used in the
evaluation is one that facilitates the investigation of real
situations (action research, case study, field study, interviews,
descriptive, or exploratory surveys), then RM is evaluated to 1.
II. No contribution to relevance: If the research method used in
the evaluation does not lend itself to investigate real situations
(e.g., Laboratory trials), then RM is evaluated to 0.</p>
