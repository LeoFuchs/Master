GQM+Strategies - aligning business strategies with software measurement. GQM+Strategies is a measurement approach that builds on the well-tested GQM approach to planning and implementing software measurement. Although GQM has proven itself useful in a variety of industrial settings, one recognized weakness is the difficulty for GQM users to link software measurement goals to higher-level goals of the organization in which the software is being developed. This linkage is important, as it helps to justify software measurement efforts and allows measurement data to contribute to higher-level decisions. GQM+strategies provides mechanisms for explicitly linking software measurement goals, to higher-level goals for the software organization, and further to goals and strategies at the level of the entire business. 
The Rosetta Stone Methodology - a benefits driven approach to software process improvement. In response to the lack of a business-focused approach to software process improvement (SPI), the Rosetta Stone objective-driven SPI Methodology (RSM) has been developed which allows organizations to undertake SPI based on business-driven objectives using proven SPI methodologies. To demonstrate usefulness and practicality, the Rosetta Stone IGSI-ISM to CMMI Instance mapping (RS-ICMMI) is developed using a generic set of business objectives which are mapped to the CMMI (Staged) model using a modified version of GQM. This methodology and the RS-ICMMI instance have been validated by experts. 
Software engineering strategies: aligning software process improvement with strategic goals. Aligning software process improvement with the business and strategic goals of an enterprise is a key success factor for process improvement. Software process improvement methods typically only provide little or generic guidance for goal centered process improvements. We provide a framework for developing software engineering strategies that are aligned with corporate strategies and goals. Strategic objects as an important part of our framework can be directly aligned with SPICE or CMMI processes. This allows that any process improvement action can be systematically aligned with strategic goals. 
Business objectives as drivers for process improvement: practices and experiences at Thales Naval The Netherlands (TNNL). Over the last decade many organizations are increasingly concerned with the improvement of their hardware/software development processes. The Capability Maturity Model (CMM) and ISO9001 are well-known approaches that are applied in these initiatives. One of the major bottlenecks to the success of process improvement is the lack of business orientation. This paper reports on a process improvement initiative at Thales Naval Netherlands (TNNL). It presents an approach that has been followed to ensure a link between process improvement and business strategy. Main factors in this process improvement approach are goal decomposition and the implementation of goal-oriented measurement on three organizational levels, ie the business, the process and the team level. 
Strategic alignment of Software Process Improvement Programs Using QFD. Software process improvement programs increase the competitiveness of software development organizations. But a critical success factor in this context is the proper alignment between the strategy of such programs and the organizations business strategy. In this paper, we discuss how Quality Function Deployment can be used as a technique to align strategic goals and software process within an organization, presenting results of its application in a small company in Brazil. 
A business goal-based approach to achieving systems engineering capability maturity. Any process improvement program should be driven by and related to some set of business or overarching organizational needs. By considering change drivers in concert with the organization strategic objectives and "pains" one can develop a vision of the desired state, what the organization should look like and how it should behave after the desired changes are achieved. An appropriate reference model is then chosen and used in an assessment to identify improvement opportunities. Based on the assessment findings an action plan is developed and implemented which addresses both specific process changes and organization cultural issues. Finally, an appropriate set of measures is defined and implemented to help measure the effects of the various changes. 
Defining and monitoring strategically aligned software improvement goals. Software engineers are always aiming at improving software processes and products. However, the adoption of these improvements on software organizations must be aligned to their strategic goals. Otherwise, these improvements may not improve the organization. However, to guarantee this alignment can be complex, since improvement initiatives would have to be planned and monitored considering aspects starting from strategic level and going all the way to the organization daily operations. Thus, this work presents an approach to define and monitor software improvement goals, which are decompositions of strategic goals and are related to software products or processes. Our approach comprises strategic, tactical and operational planning activities, always aiming at strategic alignment. As important tools to monitor the goals defined, software measurement and statistical process control are also considered. An infrastructure to monitor the goals is described, and also an experience of use of the approach at a Brazilian software development organization. 
Aggregating viewpoints for strategic software process improvement - a method and a case study. Decisions regarding strategic Software Process Improvement (SPI) are generally based on the management's viewpoint of the situation, and in some cases also the viewpoints of some kind of an SPI group. This may result in strategies which are not accepted throughout the organisation, as the views of how the process is functioning are different throughout the company. A method for identifying the major factors affecting a process-improvement goal and how the perception of the importance of the factors varies throughout the organisation are described The method lets individuals from the whole development organisation rate the expected effect of these factors from their own viewpoint. In this way the strategic SPI decision can be taken using input from the entire organisation, and any discrepancies in the ratings can also give important SPI- decision information. The method is applied to a case study performed at Fuji Xerox, Tokyo. In the case study, significantly different profiles of the factor ratings came from management compared with those from the engineering staff. This result can be used to support the strategy decision as such, but also to anchor the decision in the organisation. 
Entropy based software processes improvement. Actual results of software process improvement projects show different levels of success. Although many software development organisations have adopted improvement models such as CMMI, it appears to be difficult to improve software development processes in the right way, eg tuned to the actual needs of the organisation. This paper presents a new approach to determine the direction of improvement for an organisation. This approach is based on an elaboration of the concept of entropy. The approach is empirically validated by carrying out interviews in 11 software development organisations in The Netherlands. The results of the research show that software development organisations can be classified and can be positioned on the basis of their internal and external entropy, cq the level of (dis)order in the business system and its environment. Based on a possible out-of-balance situation between the internal and external entropy, directions for software process improvement can be discussed. As such the proposed approach can support the application of current software process improvement methodologies such as the CMMI. 
SPI: 'I can't get no satisfaction' - directing process improvement to meet business needs. IT managers commonly complain of lack of resources for Software Process Improvement (SPI) projects. The authors postulate that this comes from lack of understanding by the company board of the benefit of SPI, and perhaps a lack of understanding by IT managers of the needs of the company board? So how can IT managers obtain satisfaction? A shortcoming of the ISO-9001 and the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) approaches to process improvement (in software production) is the lack of explicit connection to the business goals of the organization in question. In the eyes of business management, therefore, these models appear to represent an ‘idealized’ view of the world. A negative assessment against such a model is insufficient, in itself, to justify significant expenditure on an improvement plan. While a standardized model is invaluable as a common reference for measurement and comparison, the initiation of a meaningful improvement plan requires investment of money and allocation of resources; and that can only take place if current business goals, not an ‘ideal’ model, are the motivating force. The draft SPICE method has recognized this need. It proposes the comparison of an assessed capability profile with a target capability profile. However the current draft standard (version 2,0) contains little guidance on how to arrive at such a target capability profile. This paper describes a method for drawing up such a target capability profile. To preserve clarity, we have placed the description of our method in the context of a SPICE assessment and process improvement, but the method would also be suitable for use with ISO, CMM, ITIL or other process models. In all cases an improvement plan can be set up which is visibly geared to the business goals.
