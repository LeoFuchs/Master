Linking Software Process Improvement to Business Strategies: Experiences from Industry

The major bottleneck to the success of an SPI initiative is the lack of business orientation in the way the program is run. The post-assessment phase or how to translate assessment results into adequate improvement actions is being overdocumented compared to the assessment phase. In this article experiences and lessons learnt from two industry sources in the defense and telecommunication areas are covered. Improvement strategies based on ensuring a continuous link between the program and the business goals of the organization is advocated (e.g. the ami approach).

QFD Application in Software Process Management and Improvement Based on CMM

Capability Maturity Model (CMM) from Software Engineering Institute has been used successfully by many organizations for software process improvement. However, there exists a disconnection between business goals and maturity levels. A new framework using Quality Function Deployment (QFD) is developed to deal with this problem. This framework serves three purposes: (1) it provides a connection between business requirements and CMM; (2) it proposed a methodology for the priority assessment of requirements from multiple perspectives; and (3) it helps identify a set of software process improvement actions based on business requirements and CMM.

Application of GQM+Strategies(R) in the Japanese space industry

Aligning organizational goals and activities is of great importance for large organizations in order to improve their performance and achieve top-level business goals. Through alignment, organizational sub-units can optimize and explicitly highlight their contributions towards the achievement of top-level business goals. GQM + Strategies 1 provides a systematic, measurement-based approach for explicitly linking goals and contributions on different organizational levels. This paper presents results and experiences from applying the GQM + Strategies approach at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency.

Determining organization-specific process suitability

Having software processes that fit technological, project, and business demands is one important prerequisite for software-developing organizations to operate successfully in a sustainable way. However, many such organizations suffer from processes that do not fit their demands, either because they do not provide the necessary support, or because they provide features that are no longer necessary. This leads to unnecessary costs during the development cycle, a phenomenon that worsens over time. This paper presents the SCOPE approach for systematically determining the process demands of current and future products and projects, for analyzing existing processes aimed at satisfying these demands, and for subsequently selecting those processes that provide the most benefit for the organization. The validation showed that SCOPE is capable of adjusting an organizationâ€™s process scope in such a way that the most suitable processes are kept and the least suitable ones can be discarded.

Entropy based software processes improvement

Actual results of software process improvement projects show different levels of success. Although many software development organisations have adopted improvement models such as CMMI, it appears to be difficult to improve software development processes in the right way, e.g. tuned to the actual needs of the organisation. This paper presents a new approach to determine the direction of improvement for an organisation. This approach is based on an elaboration of the concept of entropy. The approach is empirically validated by carrying out interviews in 11 software development organisations in The Netherlands. The results of the research show that software development organisations can be classified and can be positioned on the basis of their internal and external entropy, c.q. the level of (dis)order in the business system and its environment. Based on a possible out-of-balance situation between the internal and external entropy, directions for software process improvement can be discussed. As such the proposed approach can support the application of current software process improvement methodologies such as the CMMI.
