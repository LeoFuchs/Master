GQM+Strategies: a comprehensive methodology for aligning business strategies with software measurement. In software-intensive organizations, an organizational management system will not guarantee organizational success unless the business strategy can be translated into a set of operational software goals. The Goal Question Metric (GQM) approach has proven itself useful in a variety of industrial settings to support quantitative software project management. However, it does not address linking software measurement goals to higher-level goals of the organization in which the software is being developed. This linkage is important, as it helps to justify software measurement efforts and allows measurement data to contribute to higher-level decisions. In this paper, we propose a GQM+Strategies(R) measurement approach that builds on the GQM approach to plan and implement software measurement. GQM+Strategies(R) provides mechanisms for explicitly linking software measurement goals to higher-level goals for the software organization, and further to goals and strategies at the level of the entire business. The proposed method is illustrated in the context of an example application of the method. 
GQM+Strategies - aligning business strategies with software measurement. GQM+Strategies is a measurement approach that builds on the well-tested GQM approach to planning and implementing software measurement. Although GQM has proven itself useful in a variety of industrial settings, one recognized weakness is the difficulty for GQM users to link software measurement goals to higher-level goals of the organization in which the software is being developed. This linkage is important, as it helps to justify software measurement efforts and allows measurement data to contribute to higher-level decisions. GQM+strategies provides mechanisms for explicitly linking software measurement goals, to higher-level goals for the software organization, and further to goals and strategies at the level of the entire business. 
Applying and adjusting a software process improvement model in practice: the use of the IDEAL model in a small software enterprise. Software process improvement is a demanding and complex undertaking. To support the constitution and implementation of software process improvement schemes the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) proposes a framework, the so-called IDEAL model. This model is based on experiences from large organizations. The aim of the research described here was to investigate the suitability of the model for small software enterprises. It has therefore been deployed and adjusted for successful use in a small Danish software company. The course of the project and the application of the model are presented and the case is reflected on the background of current knowledge about managing software process improvement as organizational change. 
The Rosetta Stone Methodology - a benefits driven approach to software process improvement. In response to the lack of a business-focused approach to software process improvement (SPI), the Rosetta Stone objective-driven SPI Methodology (RSM) has been developed which allows organizations to undertake SPI based on business-driven objectives using proven SPI methodologies. To demonstrate usefulness and practicality, the Rosetta Stone IGSI-ISM to CMMI Instance mapping (RS-ICMMI) is developed using a generic set of business objectives which are mapped to the CMMI (Staged) model using a modified version of GQM. This methodology and the RS-ICMMI instance have been validated by experts. 
Business objectives as drivers for process improvement: practices and experiences at Thales Naval The Netherlands (TNNL). Over the last decade many organizations are increasingly concerned with the improvement of their hardware/software development processes. The Capability Maturity Model (CMM) and ISO9001 are well-known approaches that are applied in these initiatives. One of the major bottlenecks to the success of process improvement is the lack of business orientation. This paper reports on a process improvement initiative at Thales Naval Netherlands (TNNL). It presents an approach that has been followed to ensure a link between process improvement and business strategy. Main factors in this process improvement approach are goal decomposition and the implementation of goal-oriented measurement on three organizational levels, ie the business, the process and the team level. 
Business-oriented software process improvement based on CMMI using QFD. Software Process Improvement (SPI) has become the key to the survival of many software development organizations. As a follow-up of a previous paper on SPI for the CMM using Quality Function Deployment (QFD), a new SPI framework integrating QFD with the CMMI is developed. Similar to the earlier SPI framework for the CMM, the proposed SPI framework based on the CMMI using QFD aims to achieve three objectives: (1) to map process requirements, including business requirements, to the CMMI with the help of QFD; (2) to develop a method based on QFD for the integration and prioritization of requirements from multiple perspectives (groups); and (3) to be able to prioritize software process improvement actions based on process requirements. Process requirements from multiples groups of stakeholders (perspectives), including business goals, are integrated and prioritized. SPI actions are linked to these process requirements using QFD. Thus, the priorities of actions reflect the priorities of process requirements. By executing the actions with the highest priorities, the highest satisfaction level of process requirements can be achieved. One unique feature of the framework for the CMMI Continuous representation is that the priority values of these actions can be compared across PAs, even when the PAs attempt to reach different capability levels. 
Software Process Improvement: supporting the linking of the software and the business strategies. The market is becoming more and more competitive, a lot of products and services depend of the software product and the software is one of the most important assets, which influence the organizations businesses. Considering this context, we can observe that the companies must to deal with the software, developing or acquiring, carefully. One of the perspectives that can help to take advantage of the software, supporting effectively the business, is to invest on the organizations software processes. This paper presents an approach to evaluate and improve the processes assets of the software organizations, based on internationally well-known standards and process models. This approach is supported by automated tools from the TABA Workstation and is part of a wider improvement strategy constituted of three layers (organizational layer, process execution layer and external entity layer). Moreover, this paper presents the experience of use and their results. 
Aggregating viewpoints for strategic software process improvement - a method and a case study. Decisions regarding strategic Software Process Improvement (SPI) are generally based on the management's viewpoint of the situation, and in some cases also the viewpoints of some kind of an SPI group. This may result in strategies which are not accepted throughout the organisation, as the views of how the process is functioning are different throughout the company. A method for identifying the major factors affecting a process-improvement goal and how the perception of the importance of the factors varies throughout the organisation are described The method lets individuals from the whole development organisation rate the expected effect of these factors from their own viewpoint. In this way the strategic SPI decision can be taken using input from the entire organisation, and any discrepancies in the ratings can also give important SPI- decision information. The method is applied to a case study performed at Fuji Xerox, Tokyo. In the case study, significantly different profiles of the factor ratings came from management compared with those from the engineering staff. This result can be used to support the strategy decision as such, but also to anchor the decision in the organisation. 
Integration of strategic management, process improvement and quantitative measurement for managing the competitiveness of software engineering organizations. Strategic management is a key discipline that permits companies to achieve their competitive goals. An effective and explicit alignment and integration of business strategy with SPI initiatives based on measurement is essential to prevent loss of income, customers and competitiveness. By integrating SPI models and measurement techniques in the strategy management process, an organizations investments will be better aligned with strategy, optimizing the benefits obtained as a result of an SPI program. In this paper, the authors propose BOQM (Balanced Objective-Quantifiers Methodology) that integrates properly strategic management, process improvement and quantitative measurement to manage the competitiveness of software engineering organizations. Finally, this paper presents and discusses the results from implementing BOQM in a software development organization. 
The Rosetta Stone Methodology â€“ a benefits-driven approach to SPI. The Rosetta Stone Methodology (RSM) has been developed which allows organizations to undertake Software Process Improvement (SPI) based on business- and organizational-driven goals and objectives. The methodology itself is fully customizable and allows organizations to make adjustments to the model where they feel it appropriate. To demonstrate the usefulness, appropriateness and practicality of this new approach, the Rosetta Stone IGSI-ISM to CMMI Instance mapping (RS-ICMMI) is developed. To aid in understanding, the Measurement and Analysis (MA) process area is used as an example of how to apply the methodology. The Rosetta Stone Methodology and the RS-ICMMI instance have been validated by experts.
