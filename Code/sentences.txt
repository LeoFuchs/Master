Software engineering strategies: aligning software process improvement with strategic goals. Aligning software process improvement with the business and strategic goals of an enterprise is a key success factor for process improvement. Software process improvement methods typically only provide little or generic guidance for goal centered process improvements. We provide a framework for developing software engineering strategies that are aligned with corporate strategies and goals. Strategic objects as an important part of our framework can be directly aligned with SPICE or CMMI processes. This allows that any process improvement action can be systematically aligned with strategic goals. 
Linking software process improvement to business strategies: experiences from industry. The major bottleneck to the success of an SPI initiative is the lack of business orientation in the way the program is run. The post-assessment phase or how to translate assessment results into adequate improvement actions is being overdocumented compared to the assessment phase. In this article experiences and lessons learnt from two industry sources in the defense and telecommunication areas are covered. Improvement strategies based on ensuring a continuous link between the program and the business goals of the organization is advocated (eg the ami approach). 
Business-oriented software process improvement based on CMMI using QFD. Software Process Improvement (SPI) has become the key to the survival of many software development organizations. As a follow-up of a previous paper on SPI for the CMM using Quality Function Deployment (QFD), a new SPI framework integrating QFD with the CMMI is developed. Similar to the earlier SPI framework for the CMM, the proposed SPI framework based on the CMMI using QFD aims to achieve three objectives: (1) to map process requirements, including business requirements, to the CMMI with the help of QFD; (2) to develop a method based on QFD for the integration and prioritization of requirements from multiple perspectives (groups); and (3) to be able to prioritize software process improvement actions based on process requirements. Process requirements from multiples groups of stakeholders (perspectives), including business goals, are integrated and prioritized. SPI actions are linked to these process requirements using QFD. Thus, the priorities of actions reflect the priorities of process requirements. By executing the actions with the highest priorities, the highest satisfaction level of process requirements can be achieved. One unique feature of the framework for the CMMI Continuous representation is that the priority values of these actions can be compared across PAs, even when the PAs attempt to reach different capability levels. 
QFD application in software process management and improvement based on CMM. Capability Maturity Model (CMM) from Software Engineering Institute has been used successfully by many organizations for software process improvement. However, there exists a disconnection between business goals and maturity levels. A new framework using Quality Function Deployment (QFD) is developed to deal with this problem. This framework serves three purposes: (1) it provides a connection between business requirements and CMM; (2) it proposed a methodology for the priority assessment of requirements from multiple perspectives; and (3) it helps identify a set of software process improvement actions based on business requirements and CMM. 
A business goal-based approach to achieving systems engineering capability maturity. Any process improvement program should be driven by and related to some set of business or overarching organizational needs. By considering change drivers in concert with the organization strategic objectives and "pains" one can develop a vision of the desired state, what the organization should look like and how it should behave after the desired changes are achieved. An appropriate reference model is then chosen and used in an assessment to identify improvement opportunities. Based on the assessment findings an action plan is developed and implemented which addresses both specific process changes and organization cultural issues. Finally, an appropriate set of measures is defined and implemented to help measure the effects of the various changes. 
Application of GQM+Strategies(R) in the Japanese space industry. Aligning organizational goals and activities is of great importance for large organizations in order to improve their performance and achieve top-level business goals. Through alignment, organizational sub-units can optimize and explicitly highlight their contributions towards the achievement of top-level business goals. GQM+Strategies provides a systematic, measurement-based approach for explicitly linking goals and contributions on different organizational levels. This paper presents results and experiences from applying the GQM+Strategies approach at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. 
Aggregating viewpoints for strategic software process improvement - a method and a case study. Decisions regarding strategic Software Process Improvement (SPI) are generally based on the management's viewpoint of the situation, and in some cases also the viewpoints of some kind of an SPI group. This may result in strategies which are not accepted throughout the organisation, as the views of how the process is functioning are different throughout the company. A method for identifying the major factors affecting a process-improvement goal and how the perception of the importance of the factors varies throughout the organisation are described The method lets individuals from the whole development organisation rate the expected effect of these factors from their own viewpoint. In this way the strategic SPI decision can be taken using input from the entire organisation, and any discrepancies in the ratings can also give important SPI- decision information. The method is applied to a case study performed at Fuji Xerox, Tokyo. In the case study, significantly different profiles of the factor ratings came from management compared with those from the engineering staff. This result can be used to support the strategy decision as such, but also to anchor the decision in the organisation. 
SPI: 'I can't get no satisfaction' - directing process improvement to meet business needs. IT managers commonly complain of lack of resources for Software Process Improvement (SPI) projects. The authors postulate that this comes from lack of understanding by the company board of the benefit of SPI, and perhaps a lack of understanding by IT managers of the needs of the company board? So how can IT managers obtain satisfaction? A shortcoming of the ISO-9001 and the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) approaches to process improvement (in software production) is the lack of explicit connection to the business goals of the organization in question. In the eyes of business management, therefore, these models appear to represent an ‘idealized’ view of the world. A negative assessment against such a model is insufficient, in itself, to justify significant expenditure on an improvement plan. While a standardized model is invaluable as a common reference for measurement and comparison, the initiation of a meaningful improvement plan requires investment of money and allocation of resources; and that can only take place if current business goals, not an ‘ideal’ model, are the motivating force. The draft SPICE method has recognized this need. It proposes the comparison of an assessed capability profile with a target capability profile. However the current draft standard (version 2,0) contains little guidance on how to arrive at such a target capability profile. This paper describes a method for drawing up such a target capability profile. To preserve clarity, we have placed the description of our method in the context of a SPICE assessment and process improvement, but the method would also be suitable for use with ISO, CMM, ITIL or other process models. In all cases an improvement plan can be set up which is visibly geared to the business goals. 
Integration of strategic management, process improvement and quantitative measurement for managing the competitiveness of software engineering organizations. Strategic management is a key discipline that permits companies to achieve their competitive goals. An effective and explicit alignment and integration of business strategy with SPI initiatives based on measurement is essential to prevent loss of income, customers and competitiveness. By integrating SPI models and measurement techniques in the strategy management process, an organizations investments will be better aligned with strategy, optimizing the benefits obtained as a result of an SPI program. In this paper, the authors propose BOQM (Balanced Objective-Quantifiers Methodology) that integrates properly strategic management, process improvement and quantitative measurement to manage the competitiveness of software engineering organizations. Finally, this paper presents and discusses the results from implementing BOQM in a software development organization. 
The Rosetta Stone Methodology – a benefits-driven approach to SPI. The Rosetta Stone Methodology (RSM) has been developed which allows organizations to undertake Software Process Improvement (SPI) based on business- and organizational-driven goals and objectives. The methodology itself is fully customizable and allows organizations to make adjustments to the model where they feel it appropriate. To demonstrate the usefulness, appropriateness and practicality of this new approach, the Rosetta Stone IGSI-ISM to CMMI Instance mapping (RS-ICMMI) is developed. To aid in understanding, the Measurement and Analysis (MA) process area is used as an example of how to apply the methodology. The Rosetta Stone Methodology and the RS-ICMMI instance have been validated by experts.
