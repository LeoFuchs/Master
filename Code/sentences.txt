Aligning software-related strategies in multi-organizational settings. Aligning the activities of an organization with its business goals is a challenging task that is critical for success. Alignment in a multi-organizational setting requires the integration of different internal or external organizational units. The anticipated benefits of multi-organizational alignment consist of clarified contributions and increased transparency of the involved organizational units. The GQM+Strategies approach provides mechanisms for explicitly linking goals and strategies within an organization and is based on goal-oriented measurement. This paper presents the process and first-hand experience of applying GQM+Strategies in a multi-organizational setting from the aerospace industry. Additionally, the resulting GQM+Strategies grid is sketched and selected parts are discussed. Finally, the results are reflected on and an overview of future work is given. 
Software engineering strategies: aligning software process improvement with strategic goals. Aligning software process improvement with the business and strategic goals of an enterprise is a key success factor for process improvement. Software process improvement methods typically only provide little or generic guidance for goal centered process improvements. We provide a framework for developing software engineering strategies that are aligned with corporate strategies and goals. Strategic objects as an important part of our framework can be directly aligned with SPICE or CMMI processes. This allows that any process improvement action can be systematically aligned with strategic goals. 
Business-oriented process improvement: practices and experiences at Thales Naval The Netherlands (TNNL). Over the last decade many organizations are increasingly concerned with the improvement of their hardware/software development processes. The Capability Maturity Model and ISO9001 are well-known approaches that are applied in these initiatives. However, one of the major bottlenecks to the success of process improvement is the lack of business goal orientation. Additionally, business-oriented improvement approaches often show a lack of process orientation. This paper reports on a process improvement initiative at Thales Naval Netherlands that attempts to combine the best of both worlds, ie process improvement and business goal orientation. Main factors in this approach are goal decomposition and the implementation of goal-oriented measurement on three organizational levels, ie the business, the process and the team level. 
Aligning organizations through measurement: the GQM+Strategies approach. Aligning an organization’s goals and strategies requires specifying their rationales and connections so that the links are explicit and allow for analytic reasoning about what is successful and where improvement is necessary. This book provides guidance on how to achieve this alignment, how to monitor the success of goals and strategies and use measurement to recognize potential failures, and how to close alignment gaps. It uses the GQM+Strategies approach, which provides concepts and actionable steps for creating the link between goals and strategies across an organization and allows for measurement-based decision-making. After outlining the general motivation for organizational alignment through measurement, the GQM+Strategies approach is described concisely, with a focus on the basic model that is created and the process for creating and using this model. The recommended steps of all six phases of the process are then described in detail with the help of a comprehensive application example. Finally, the industrial challenges addressed by the method and cases of its application in industry are presented, and the relations to other approaches, such as Balanced Scorecard, are described. The book concludes with supplementary material, such as checklists and guidelines, to support the application of the method. This book is aimed at organization leaders, managers, decision makers, and other professionals interested in aligning their organization’s goals and strategies and establishing an efficient strategic measurement program. It is also interesting for academic researchers looking for mechanisms to integrate their research results into organizational environments. 
Business objectives as drivers for process improvement: practices and experiences at Thales Naval The Netherlands (TNNL). Over the last decade many organizations are increasingly concerned with the improvement of their hardware/software development processes. The Capability Maturity Model (CMM) and ISO9001 are well-known approaches that are applied in these initiatives. One of the major bottlenecks to the success of process improvement is the lack of business orientation. This paper reports on a process improvement initiative at Thales Naval Netherlands (TNNL). It presents an approach that has been followed to ensure a link between process improvement and business strategy. Main factors in this process improvement approach are goal decomposition and the implementation of goal-oriented measurement on three organizational levels, ie the business, the process and the team level. 
Strategic alignment of Software Process Improvement Programs Using QFD. Software process improvement programs increase the competitiveness of software development organizations. But a critical success factor in this context is the proper alignment between the strategy of such programs and the organizations business strategy. In this paper, we discuss how Quality Function Deployment can be used as a technique to align strategic goals and software process within an organization, presenting results of its application in a small company in Brazil. 
Linking software strategy through and business development measurement. The GQM+Strategies approach extends the goal/question/metric paradigm for measuring the success or failure of goals and strategies, adding enterprise-wide support for determining action on the basis of measurement results. An organization can thus integrate its measurement program across all levels. 
Software Process Improvement: supporting the linking of the software and the business strategies. The market is becoming more and more competitive, a lot of products and services depend of the software product and the software is one of the most important assets, which influence the organizations businesses. Considering this context, we can observe that the companies must to deal with the software, developing or acquiring, carefully. One of the perspectives that can help to take advantage of the software, supporting effectively the business, is to invest on the organizations software processes. This paper presents an approach to evaluate and improve the processes assets of the software organizations, based on internationally well-known standards and process models. This approach is supported by automated tools from the TABA Workstation and is part of a wider improvement strategy constituted of three layers (organizational layer, process execution layer and external entity layer). Moreover, this paper presents the experience of use and their results. 
Aggregating viewpoints for strategic software process improvement - a method and a case study. Decisions regarding strategic Software Process Improvement (SPI) are generally based on the management's viewpoint of the situation, and in some cases also the viewpoints of some kind of an SPI group. This may result in strategies which are not accepted throughout the organisation, as the views of how the process is functioning are different throughout the company. A method for identifying the major factors affecting a process-improvement goal and how the perception of the importance of the factors varies throughout the organisation are described The method lets individuals from the whole development organisation rate the expected effect of these factors from their own viewpoint. In this way the strategic SPI decision can be taken using input from the entire organisation, and any discrepancies in the ratings can also give important SPI- decision information. The method is applied to a case study performed at Fuji Xerox, Tokyo. In the case study, significantly different profiles of the factor ratings came from management compared with those from the engineering staff. This result can be used to support the strategy decision as such, but also to anchor the decision in the organisation. 
Entropy based software processes improvement. Actual results of software process improvement projects show different levels of success. Although many software development organisations have adopted improvement models such as CMMI, it appears to be difficult to improve software development processes in the right way, eg tuned to the actual needs of the organisation. This paper presents a new approach to determine the direction of improvement for an organisation. This approach is based on an elaboration of the concept of entropy. The approach is empirically validated by carrying out interviews in 11 software development organisations in The Netherlands. The results of the research show that software development organisations can be classified and can be positioned on the basis of their internal and external entropy, cq the level of (dis)order in the business system and its environment. Based on a possible out-of-balance situation between the internal and external entropy, directions for software process improvement can be discussed. As such the proposed approach can support the application of current software process improvement methodologies such as the CMMI.
