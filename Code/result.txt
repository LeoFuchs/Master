Software engineering strategies: aligning software process improvement with strategic goals. Aligning software process improvement with the business and strategic goals of an enterprise is a key success factor for process improvement. Software process improvement methods typically only provide little or generic guidance for goal centered process improvements. We provide a framework for developing software engineering strategies that are aligned with corporate strategies and goals. Strategic objects as an important part of our framework can be directly aligned with SPICE or CMMI processes. This allows that any process improvement action can be systematically aligned with strategic goals. 
Aligning organizations through measurement: the GQM+Strategies approach. Aligning an organization’s goals and strategies requires specifying their rationales and connections so that the links are explicit and allow for analytic reasoning about what is successful and where improvement is necessary. This book provides guidance on how to achieve this alignment, how to monitor the success of goals and strategies and use measurement to recognize potential failures, and how to close alignment gaps. It uses the GQM+Strategies approach, which provides concepts and actionable steps for creating the link between goals and strategies across an organization and allows for measurement-based decision-making. After outlining the general motivation for organizational alignment through measurement, the GQM+Strategies approach is described concisely, with a focus on the basic model that is created and the process for creating and using this model. The recommended steps of all six phases of the process are then described in detail with the help of a comprehensive application example. Finally, the industrial challenges addressed by the method and cases of its application in industry are presented, and the relations to other approaches, such as Balanced Scorecard, are described. The book concludes with supplementary material, such as checklists and guidelines, to support the application of the method. This book is aimed at organization leaders, managers, decision makers, and other professionals interested in aligning their organization’s goals and strategies and establishing an efficient strategic measurement program. It is also interesting for academic researchers looking for mechanisms to integrate their research results into organizational environments. 


Business objectives as drivers for process improvement: practices and experiences at Thales Naval The Netherlands (TNNL). Over the last decade many organizations are increasingly concerned with the improvement of their hardware/software development processes. The Capability Maturity Model (CMM) and ISO9001 are well-known approaches that are applied in these initiatives. One of the major bottlenecks to the success of process improvement is the lack of business orientation. This paper reports on a process improvement initiative at Thales Naval Netherlands (TNNL). It presents an approach that has been followed to ensure a link between process improvement and business strategy. Main factors in this process improvement approach are goal decomposition and the implementation of goal-oriented measurement on three organizational levels, ie the business, the process and the team level. 
Managing process inconsistency using viewpoints. Discusses the notion of software process inconsistency and suggests that inconsistencies in software processes are inevitable and sometimes desirable. We present an approach to process analysis that helps discover different perceptions of a software process and that supports the discovery of process inconsistencies and process improvements stimulated by these inconsistencies. By analogy with viewpoints for requirements engineering that allow multiple perspectives on a software system specification to be managed, we have developed the notion of process viewpoints that provide multi-perspective descriptions of software processes. A process viewpoint includes a statement of focus or "world view", a set of sources of process information, a process description and a set of organizational concerns that represent goals or constraints on the process analysis. We present a description and rationale of process viewpoints, discuss the process of applying process viewpoints for process understanding, and illustrate the overall approach using part of a case study drawn from industrial processes that are part of a safety-critical system development. 


QFD application in software process management and improvement based on CMM. Capability Maturity Model (CMM) from Software Engineering Institute has been used successfully by many organizations for software process improvement. However, there exists a disconnection between business goals and maturity levels. A new framework using Quality Function Deployment (QFD) is developed to deal with this problem. This framework serves three purposes: (1) it provides a connection between business requirements and CMM; (2) it proposed a methodology for the priority assessment of requirements from multiple perspectives; and (3) it helps identify a set of software process improvement actions based on business requirements and CMM. 
Defining and monitoring strategically aligned software improvement goals. Software engineers are always aiming at improving software processes and products. However, the adoption of these improvements on software organizations must be aligned to their strategic goals. Otherwise, these improvements may not improve the organization. However, to guarantee this alignment can be complex, since improvement initiatives would have to be planned and monitored considering aspects starting from strategic level and going all the way to the organization daily operations. Thus, this work presents an approach to define and monitor software improvement goals, which are decompositions of strategic goals and are related to software products or processes. Our approach comprises strategic, tactical and operational planning activities, always aiming at strategic alignment. As important tools to monitor the goals defined, software measurement and statistical process control are also considered. An infrastructure to monitor the goals is described, and also an experience of use of the approach at a Brazilian software development organization. 
Determining organization-specific process suitability. Having software processes that fit technological, project, and business demands is one important prerequisite for software-developing organizations to operate successfully in a sustainable way. However, many such organizations suffer from processes that do not fit their demands, either because they do not provide the necessary support, or because they provide features that are no longer necessary. This leads to unnecessary costs during the development cycle, a phenomenon that worsens over time. This paper presents the SCOPE approach for systematically determining the process demands of current and future products and projects, for analyzing existing processes aimed at satisfying these demands, and for subsequently selecting those processes that provide the most benefit for the organization. The validation showed that SCOPE is capable of adjusting an organization’s process scope in such a way that the most suitable processes are kept and the least suitable ones can be discarded. 
SPI: 'I can't get no satisfaction' - directing process improvement to meet business needs. IT managers commonly complain of lack of resources for Software Process Improvement (SPI) projects. The authors postulate that this comes from lack of understanding by the company board of the benefit of SPI, and perhaps a lack of understanding by IT managers of the needs of the company board? So how can IT managers obtain satisfaction? A shortcoming of the ISO-9001 and the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) approaches to process improvement (in software production) is the lack of explicit connection to the business goals of the organization in question. In the eyes of business management, therefore, these models appear to represent an ‘idealized’ view of the world. A negative assessment against such a model is insufficient, in itself, to justify significant expenditure on an improvement plan. While a standardized model is invaluable as a common reference for measurement and comparison, the initiation of a meaningful improvement plan requires investment of money and allocation of resources; and that can only take place if current business goals, not an ‘ideal’ model, are the motivating force. The draft SPICE method has recognized this need. It proposes the comparison of an assessed capability profile with a target capability profile. However the current draft standard (version 2,0) contains little guidance on how to arrive at such a target capability profile. This paper describes a method for drawing up such a target capability profile. To preserve clarity, we have placed the description of our method in the context of a SPICE assessment and process improvement, but the method would also be suitable for use with ISO, CMM, ITIL or other process models. In all cases an improvement plan can be set up which is visibly geared to the business goals. 
An approach to support the strategic alignment of software process improvement programs. The alignment between the strategy of a software process improvement program and the organizations business strategies has been mentioned as a critical factor of success. However, the main software process reference models do not explicitly guide the companies towards defining processes which meet their strategic goals. Based on this context, the purpose of this paper is to present a process for the strategic alignment of software process improvement programs. Preliminary results indicate benefits beyond the demands of a software process reference model itself, which include the planning and execution of a software process improvement program taking into account the organizations strategic goals in a more systematic way. 
The Rosetta Stone Methodology – a benefits-driven approach to SPI. The Rosetta Stone Methodology (RSM) has been developed which allows organizations to undertake Software Process Improvement (SPI) based on business- and organizational-driven goals and objectives. The methodology itself is fully customizable and allows organizations to make adjustments to the model where they feel it appropriate. To demonstrate the usefulness, appropriateness and practicality of this new approach, the Rosetta Stone IGSI-ISM to CMMI Instance mapping (RS-ICMMI) is developed. To aid in understanding, the Measurement and Analysis (MA) process area is used as an example of how to apply the methodology. The Rosetta Stone Methodology and the RS-ICMMI instance have been validated by experts.
