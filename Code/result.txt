Software Process Improvement: supporting the linking of the software and the business strategies. The market is becoming more and more competitive, a lot of products and services depend of the software product and the software is one of the most important assets, which influence the organizations businesses. Considering this context, we can observe that the companies must to deal with the software, developing or acquiring, carefully. One of the perspectives that can help to take advantage of the software, supporting effectively the business, is to invest on the organizations software processes. This paper presents an approach to evaluate and improve the processes assets of the software organizations, based on internationally well-known standards and process models. This approach is supported by automated tools from the TABA Workstation and is part of a wider improvement strategy constituted of three layers (organizational layer, process execution layer and external entity layer). Moreover, this paper presents the experience of use and their results. 
Strategic alignment of software process improvement programs using QFD. Software process improvement programs increase the competitiveness of software development organizations. But a critical success factor in this context is the proper alignment between the strategy of such programs and the organizations business strategy. In this paper, we discuss how Quality Function Deployment can be used as a technique to align strategic goals and software process within an organization, presenting results of its application in a small company in Brazil. 
Business-oriented software process improvement based on CMMI using QFD. Software Process Improvement (SPI) has become the key to the survival of many software development organizations. As a follow-up of a previous paper on SPI for the CMM using Quality Function Deployment (QFD), a new SPI framework integrating QFD with the CMMI is developed. Similar to the earlier SPI framework for the CMM, the proposed SPI framework based on the CMMI using QFD aims to achieve three objectives: (1) to map process requirements, including business requirements, to the CMMI with the help of QFD; (2) to develop a method based on QFD for the integration and prioritization of requirements from multiple perspectives (groups); and (3) to be able to prioritize software process improvement actions based on process requirements. Process requirements from multiples groups of stakeholders (perspectives), including business goals, are integrated and prioritized. SPI actions are linked to these process requirements using QFD. Thus, the priorities of actions reflect the priorities of process requirements. By executing the actions with the highest priorities, the highest satisfaction level of process requirements can be achieved. One unique feature of the framework for the CMMI Continuous representation is that the priority values of these actions can be compared across PAs, even when the PAs attempt to reach different capability levels.  
Entropy based software processes improvement. Actual results of software process improvement projects show different levels of success. Although many software development organisations have adopted improvement models such as CMMI, it appears to be difficult to improve software development processes in the right way, eg tuned to the actual needs of the organisation. This paper presents a new approach to determine the direction of improvement for an organisation. This approach is based on an elaboration of the concept of entropy. The approach is empirically validated by carrying out interviews in 11 software development organisations in The Netherlands. The results of the research show that software development organisations can be classified and can be positioned on the basis of their internal and external entropy, cq the level of (dis)order in the business system and its environment. Based on a possible out-of-balance situation between the internal and external entropy, directions for software process improvement can be discussed. As such the proposed approach can support the application of current software process improvement methodologies such as the CMMI. 
Business-oriented process improvement: practices and experiences at Thales Naval The Netherlands (TNNL). Over the last decade many organizations are increasingly concerned with the improvement of their hardware/software development processes. The Capability Maturity Model and ISO9001 are well-known approaches that are applied in these initiatives. However, one of the major bottlenecks to the success of process improvement is the lack of business goal orientation. Additionally, business-oriented improvement approaches often show a lack of process orientation. This paper reports on a process improvement initiative at Thales Naval Netherlands that attempts to combine the best of both worlds, ie process improvement and business goal orientation. Main factors in this approach are goal decomposition and the implementation of goal-oriented measurement on three organizational levels, ie the business, the process and the team level.  
Linking software process improvement to business strategies: experiences from industry. The major bottleneck to the success of an SPI initiative is the lack of business orientation in the way the program is run. The post-assessment phase or how to translate assessment results into adequate improvement actions is being overdocumented compared to the assessment phase. In this article experiences and lessons learnt from two industry sources in the defense and telecommunication areas are covered. Improvement strategies based on ensuring a continuous link between the program and the business goals of the organization is advocated (eg the ami approach). 
Integration of strategic management, process improvement and quantitative measurement for managing the competitiveness of software engineering organizations. Strategic management is a key discipline that permits companies to achieve their competitive goals. An effective and explicit alignment and integration of business strategy with SPI initiatives based on measurement is essential to prevent loss of income, customers and competitiveness. By integrating SPI models and measurement techniques in the strategy management process, an organizations investments will be better aligned with strategy, optimizing the benefits obtained as a result of an SPI program. In this paper, the authors propose BOQM (Balanced Objective-Quantifiers Methodology) that integrates properly strategic management, process improvement and quantitative measurement to manage the competitiveness of software engineering organizations. Finally, this paper presents and discusses the results from implementing BOQM in a software development organization. 
Linking software strategy through and business development measurement. The GQM+Strategies approach extends the goal/question/metric paradigm for measuring the success or failure of goals and strategies, adding enterprise-wide support for determining action on the basis of measurement results. An organization can thus integrate its measurement program across all levels. 
Bridging the gap between business strategy and software development. In software-intensive organizations, an organizational management system will not guarantee organizational success unless the business strategy can be translated into a set of operational software goals. The Goal Question Metric (GQM) approach has proven itself useful in a variety of industrial settings to support quantitative software project management. However, it does not address linking software measurement goals to higher-level goals of the organization in which the software is being developed. This linkage is important, as it helps to justify software measurement efforts and allows measurement data to contribute to higher-level decisions. In this paper, we propose a GQM+Strategies measurement approach that builds on the GQM approach to plan and implement software measurement. GQM+Strategies provides mechanisms for explicitly linking software measurement goals to higher-level goals for the software organization, and further to goals and strategies at the level of the entire business. An example application of the proposed method is illustrated in the context of an example measurement initiative. 
Defining and monitoring strategically aligned software improvement goals. Software engineers are always aiming at improving software processes and products. However, the adoption of these improvements on software organizations must be aligned to their strategic goals. Otherwise, these improvements may not improve the organization. However, to guarantee this alignment can be complex, since improvement initiatives would have to be planned and monitored considering aspects starting from strategic level and going all the way to the organization daily operations. Thus, this work presents an approach to define and monitor software improvement goals, which are decompositions of strategic goals and are related to software products or processes. Our approach comprises strategic, tactical and operational planning activities, always aiming at strategic alignment. As important tools to monitor the goals defined, software measurement and statistical process control are also considered. An infrastructure to monitor the goals is described, and also an experience of use of the approach at a Brazilian software development organization.
