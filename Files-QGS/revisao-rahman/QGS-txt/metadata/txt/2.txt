Title: Co-evolution of Infrastructure and Source Code - An Empirical Study

Abstract: Infrastructure-as-code automates the process of configuring and setting up the environment (e.g., servers, VMs and databases) in which a software system will be tested and/or deployed, through textual specification files in a language like Puppet or Chef. Since the environment is instantiated automatically by the infrastructure languages tools, no manual intervention is necessary apart from maintaining the infrastructure specification files. The amount of work involved with such maintenance, as well as the size and complexity of infrastructure specification files, have not yet been studied empirically. Through an empirical study of the version control system of 265 OpenStack projects, we find that infrastructure files are large and churn frequently, which could indicate a potential of introducing bugs. Furthermore, we found that the infrastructure code files are coupled tightly with the other files in a project, especially test files,
which implies that testers often need to change infrastructure specifications when making changes to the test framework and tests.
