The Top 10 Adages in Continuous Deployment 

Continuous deployment involves automatically testing incremental software changes and frequently deploying them to production environments. With it, developers' changes can reach customers in days or even hours. Such ultrafast changes create a new reality in software development. To understand the emerging practices surrounding continuous deployment, researchers facilitated a one-day Continuous Deployment Summit at the Facebook campus in July 2015, at which participants from 10 companies described how they used continuous deployment. From the resulting conversation, the researchers derived 10 adages about continuous-deployment practices. These adages represent a working set of approaches and beliefs that guide current practice and establish a tangible target for empirical validation by the research community.
