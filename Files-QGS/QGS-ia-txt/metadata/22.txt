Title: DASyR(IR) Document Analysis System for Systematic Reviews (in Information Retrieval)

Keywords: 

Abstract: 
Creating systematic reviews is a painstaking task undertaken especially in domains where experimental results are the primary method to knowledge creation. For the review au­thors, analysing documents to extract relevant data is a demand­ing activity. To support the creation of systematic reviews, we have created DASyR-a semi-automatic document analysis system. DASyR is our solution to annotating published papers for the
purpose of ontology population. For domains where dictionaries are not existing or inadequate, DASyR relies on a semi-automatic annotation bootstrapping method based on positional Random Indexing, followed by traditional Machine Learning algorithms to
extend the annotation set. We provide an example of the method application to a subdomain of Computer Science, the Information Retrieval evaluation domain. T he reliance of this domain on large scale experimental studies makes it a perfect domain to test on. We show the utility of DASyR through experimental results for different parameter values for the bootstrap procedure, evaluated in terms of annotator agreement, error rate, precision and recall.
