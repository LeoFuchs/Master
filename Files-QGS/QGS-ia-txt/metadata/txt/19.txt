Title: Clustering of Medical Publications for Evidence Based Medicine Summarisation

Keywords: Machine Learning, Automatic Text Classification, Systematic Reviews, Ranking Algorithms.

Abstract: 
We present a study of the clustering properties of medical publications for the aim of Evidence Based Medicine summarisation. Given a dataset of documents that have been manually assigned to groups related to clinical answers, we apply K-Means clustering and
verify that the documents can be clustered reasonably well. We advance the implications of such clustering for natural language processing tasks in Evidence Based Medicine.
