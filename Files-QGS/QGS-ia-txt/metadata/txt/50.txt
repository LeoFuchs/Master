Title: Using Information Visualization and Text Mining to Facilitate the Conduction of Systematic Literature Reviews

Keywords: Systematic literature review, Systematic mapping, Tool, Visualization

Abstract: 
Systematic Literature Review (SLR or SR) and Systematic Mapping (SM) are scientific literature review techniques that follow well-defined stages, according to a protocol previously elaborated. Besides systematizing the search for relevant studies, the SR predicts the organization and the analysis of the obtained results. However, the SR application is laborious because there are many steps to be followed. Aiming to offer computational support to SR and SM, the StArt (State of the Art through Systematic Review) tool was developed. Besides helping the steps of SR or SM, the StArt tool has implemented visualization and text mining techniques to support the conduction and the
reporting of the SR or SM. A comparative analysis was carried out in relation to StArt and other similar tools.
