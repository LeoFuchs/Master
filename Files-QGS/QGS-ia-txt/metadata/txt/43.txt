Abstract: 
In this article, we describe how we are using text mining solutions to enhance the production of systematic reviews. The aims of this collaborative project are the development of a text mining framework to support systematic reviews and the provision of a service exemplar serving as a test bed for deriving requirements for the development of more generally applicable text mining tools and services.
