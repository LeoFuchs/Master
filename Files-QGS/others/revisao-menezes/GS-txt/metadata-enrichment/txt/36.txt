Identifying Causality Relation between Software Projects Risk Factors. Software development process is vulnerable to different risk factors. Several works were done in order to identify these factors and to introduce new ones. On the other hand, little research has been conducted around investigating the relationship between these risk factors. In this paper, a detailed set of software risk factors were examined. It was found that the relationship between these factors is a (cause- effect) relationship. As a result, a causality table and a cause-effect diagram are introduced to illustrate this causality relationship.
