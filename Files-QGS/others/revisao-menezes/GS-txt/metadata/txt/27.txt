Risks Response Strategies for Supporting Practitioners Decision-Making in Software Projects

Enterprises make great efforts to adopt up-to-the-minute technologies and completely new systems. Despite these efforts, software projects outcomes are not successful. Indeed, poor risk management of software projects often leads to failure, which can impact the project outcomes. For this reason, practitioners should follow a risks strategy that drives their software project toward success. To address this need, this paper presents a risks checklist of software projects. This gathers together the risks affecting the performance of software projects. Moreover, the authors use the importance-performance approach to assess the risks factors identified. The findings allowed us to define the most suitable strategy for
managing each risk in more effective way.
