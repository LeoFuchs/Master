Managing Software Project Risks (Design Phase) with Proposed Fuzzy Regression Analysis Techniques with Fuzzy Concepts

This Regardless how much effort we put for the success of software projects, many software projects have very high failure rate. Risk is not always avoidable, but ii is controllable. The aim of this paper the new is to present mining technique that uses the fuzzy multiple regression analysis techniques with fuzzy concepts to managing the risks in a software project and reducing risk with software process improvement. Top ten software risk factors in design phase and thirty risk management techniques were presented to respondents. 17,e results show that all risks in software projects were important in software project manager perspective, whereas all risk management techniques are used most of time. and often. However, these mining tests were the risk management performed using fuzzy multiple regression analysis techniques to compare techniques to each of the software risk factors to determine if they are effective in mitigating the occurrence of each software risk factor by usjng statistical package for the Social Science (SPSS) for Manipulating and analyzing the data set, MATLAB 7.12.0 (R201 la}, wolfram mathematic 9.0,. Also ten top software risk factors were mitigated by using risk management techniques except Risk
3 "Developing the Wrong User Interface". We referred the risk management techniques were mitigated on software risk factors in Table XV. The study has been conducted on a group of will greatly improve the
software project managers. Successful project risk management probability of project success.
