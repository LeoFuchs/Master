A
CA Information system (IS) project failure is described as a
D
UN common phenomenon by both academic researchers and
yF industrial practitioners, and many researchers have studb
ied actively about success/failure factors of IS project, IS
project management and IS itself. The definitions of the
terms such as IS project, IS project management and IS
are slightly different, but there are common factors which
are cost, time and quality to affect the success/failure
critically.
153
Escalation occurs when there are continued commitments
for a troubled project. Escalation has been
observed as one pattern of failure (Keil, 1995). Various
theories explain escalation phenomenon in social science.
Self-justification theory, prospect theory, agency
theory and approach avoidance theory are representative
of escalation theory. In these theories, psychological
self-justification, social self-justification, sunk cost effect,
goal incongruency, information asymmetry and completion
effect are considered. These theories focus on the
escalation behaviour. Recently, researchers have studied
IS project escalation. According to Keil and Mann, escalation
occurs in 30-40% of IS projects, and the escalated
projects have more significant problems than nonescalated
projects have (Keil and Mann, 2000). In addition,
it is proposed that factors of project management
could predict escalation in IS development project (Keil
et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2003).
Many IS researchers have studied individual IS
project risk identification as a major source of IS development
problem and IS success as impacted by risks.
The purpose of this research was to discriminate between
escalated projects and non-escalated projects in IS development
using risk measures. First, critical risks in IS
development projects were selected from previous IS literatures
and classified into multiple risk categories. Then,
risk in each category was measured respectively and the
measures were used to predict escalation. This research
was based on 247 survey cases from IS experts in Korea.

Several different theories have been proposed
behaviour including self..IfJno
LERAD approach avoidance theory in the escalation literatures.
First, self-justification theory explains that individuals
ED seek to rationalise their previous behaviour against a
FE perceived error in judgment (Staw and Fox, 1977). SecED
ond, prospect theory suggests that individuals exhibit
A
ID risk seeking behaviour in choosing between two negative
S
ER alternatives (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979; Tversky and
INV Kahneman, 1981; Whyte, 1986). Sunk costs may influOU
ence decision makers to adopt a negative frame, thereby
CA prompting risk seeking behaviour which can be observed
DA as escalating commitment to a failing course of action
UN (Whyte, 1986). Third, under agency theory, goal inconF
by gruency between principal and agent can create a situation
in which the agent acts to maximise his or her own
utility rather than acting in the best interests of the principal,
and the agency problem that promotes escalation
behaviour will exist within organisations because the principal
cannot observe with certainty the actions and work
effort of the agent (Baiman, 1990; Harrison and Harrel,
1993; Tuttle et al., 1997). Finally, under approach avoidance
theory, escalation is conceptualised as a behaviour
that occurs when driving forces that encourage persistence
seem to outweigh restraining forces that encourage
abandonment (Brockner and Rubin, 1985).
Several researchers have applied the concept of
escalation to the domain of software project management
(Keil et al., 1995; Drummand, 1996; Newman and
Sabherwal, 1996). Escalation has been defined as continued
commitment in the face of negative information
about prior resource allocations coupled with uncertainty
surrounding the likelihood of goal attainment. In the
context of software project escalation, negative project
status refers to significant performance problems in one
or more the following areas: cost, schedule, functionality
or quality (Brockner, 1992). Project escalation can
be said to occur when there is continued commitment
and negative information. The escalation theories provide
a promising base for explaining IT failure (Keil,
1995). Keil and Mann suggested that from 30-40% of
all IS projects exhibit some degree of escalation. Escalated
projects had project outcomes that were significantly
worse in terms of perceived implementation performance
and perceived budget/schedule performance, as
compared to project that did not escalate (Keil and Mann,
2000). In addition, it was proposed that project management
factors in IS projects could discriminate between
escalated project and non-escalated one (Keil et al., 2003;
Zhang et al., 2003).
2.2. Risk
Previous IS risk studies can be categorised in terms of risk
definition, risk factor identification and categorisation and
risk management model or approach. The dictionary definition
of risk is the possibility of loss or injury. Sometimes
risk can be called risk impact or risk exposure. With reference
to software risk management, Boehm (1991) defines
risk impact or risk exposure as:
RE = P(UO) ∗ L(UO)
where RE is the risk exposure, P(UO) is the probability
of an unsatisfactory outcome and L(UO) is the loss to
the parties affected if the outcome is unsatisfactory. Barki
et al. (1993) defines software development project risk by
referring to the uncertainty surrounding a project and the
magnitude of potential loss associated with project failure:
Software development risk
= (project uncertainty) ∗ (magnitude or potential
loss due to project failure)

FE and attribute. Most of other studies show empirical idenED
tification of the risks. Large number of risks have been disIDA
cussed in IS literatures. Table 1 illustrates major software
SR risks and Table 2 summarises categorisation of software
E
IV development risks in previous literature.
NU The practice of software risk management involves
CAO two primary steps each with three subsidiary steps. The
DA first primary step, risk assessment, involves risk identiUN
fication, risk analysis and risk prioritisation. The second
F
y primary step, risk control, includes risk management planb
ning, risk resolution and risk monitoring (Boehm, 1991).
The SEI risk management paradigm is represented as a
circle to emphasise that risk management is a continuous
process. This risk management paradigm consists of
six activities: identity, analyse, plan, track, control and
communicate (SEI, 1993).
Linkage between software risks and other issues
(e.g., system success, project effectiveness and decisionmaking
to continue a project) have been explored. IS
success (e.g., development process satisfaction, customer
satisfaction, system quality satisfaction and impact of
the system on the organisation) are related to different
risk factors (Jiang et al., 1999, 2001), and risks
have a significant impact on project effectiveness (Jiang
and Klein, 2000). Keil explored the relative influence of
risk perception and risk propensity on the decision of
whether or not to continue a software development project
(Keil, 2000).

Risk occurrence as an event can be focused on one of
the three dimensions: product as an object of an event,
people as a subject of an event and process as a group of
activities related to an event. We used the three dimensions
to group risk items. The 30 risk items were classified
into three dimensions and then the three dimensions were
divided into multiple risk categories. The product dimension
has technical aspects and includes several risk categories
related to system development such as requirement,
system attribute, external or user interface and technology.

For this study, 346 cases were collected from IS experts in
Korea during June 2005. Survey questionnaire consisted
of four parts such as personnel information, project information,
organisation information and risk measurement.

addition, organisations' CMM levels of more than half
of the respondents were higher than level 2 when they
worked at the latest project according to the survey.
3.3. Data reliability
In this research, probability and loss in each nine risk category
were basically used as project escalation discriminators.
The probability of unsatisfied outcome in each
risk category was the average probability of multiple risk
items which were classified into the same risk category.
The loss due to the unsatisfied outcome in each risk category
was measured with the same way to probability.
Respective probability and loss in each risk item had fivepoint
Likert scale from very low (1) to very high (5).
Cronbach's alpha was calculated to assess measurement
reliability of the categorisation. Table 5 shows that all
alpha values are acceptable implying an adequate level of
internal consistency.
4. Analysis and Results
Among nine probability variables and nine loss variables
of risk categories there were significant correlations as
results of correlation analysis. Multicollinearity refers to
the correlation among three or more independent variables.

variance by the factor solution for each variable. Table 6
F
E presents the summary of the factor analysis. From the
D
DA results of this analysis, we obtained five risk components
ISR such as loss of risk in management, probability of risk
IEV in management, impact of risk in requirement, impact of
UN risk in technology and impact of risk in system. The five
AO components explained 73% of total variance.
CA Component 1 accounted for 42.6% of the total
D
N variance. Five variables such as human resource-loss,
U
yF customer-loss, project planning-loss, project control-loss
b and process execution-loss represented the significant
loadings of this component. It was composed of risk
loss in the people dimension and the process dimension.
Component 2 explained 8.9% of the total variance. Five
variables such as human resource-probability, customerprobability,
project planning-probability, project controlprobability
and process execution-probability showed the
significant loadings of the second component. It consisted
of risk probability in the people dimension and the process
dimension. Components 1 and 2 can be named as risk loss
in management and risk probability in management. Components
3-5 accounted for 7.6%, 7.1%, and 6.3% of the
total variance respectively. Different from components 1
and 2, components 3-5 consisted of one or two pairs of
probability and loss in one or two risk categories. Probability
and loss in requirement risk category represented
significant loadings of component 3 and probability and
loss in technology risk category indicated significant loading
of component 4. Probability and loss in attribute risk
category and interface risk category exhibited significant
loadings of component 5. Risk, risk impact or risk exposure
expresses both probability of unsatisfied outcome and
effected loss under the definition of risk by Boehm (1991).
Therefore, components 3-5 can be named as risk impact
in requirement, risk impact in technology and risk impact
in system respectively.
Logistic regression is the principal technique in this
research. This method of logistic regression was chosen
because it has widespread application in situations in
which the primary objective is to identify and to predict
the group to which an object belongs. When the dependent
variable has only two groups, logistic regression may
be preferred (Hair et al., 1998).
Let Y be a binary dependent variable, in this case
Y = 1 if the project is escalated, and Y = 0 if the project
is non-escalated. Suppose X is a vector of independent

was performed. Table 7 displays the selected variable
at the final step of the backward elimination logistic
regression. CMM level, component 2 - probability of
risk in management, component 3 - risk in requirement,
component 4 - risk in technology and intercept

validation using all software development risks. However,
the 30 risks based on this research are very critical and
referred frequently in IS literatures. Therefore, the results
of this study would be acceptable by practitioners and
researchers.
The main objective of this research was to investigate
whether software development risks were the factors to
discriminate between escalated projects and non-escalated
projects. Risk occurrence probability and degree of loss in
each nine risk category were measured on the basis of the
survey. The nine risk categories were included in one of
the three dimensions such as product, people and process.
Risks in the product dimension include risks with system
development technique aspect. On the other hand, risks
in the people dimension and the process dimension are
highly related in project management. We demonstrated
that the five risk components were extracted from probability
and loss of each nine risk category as the results of
factor analysis in Table 7. The risk components showed
technical aspect or managerial aspect. Three components
related risks in requirement, technology and system represented
system development side in IS projects. Each of the
three components had probability and loss of risk as a pair
and implied risk exposure or risk impact. Two risk components
were related to project management. One component
was almost about risk probability, and the other

dimension and process dimension.
