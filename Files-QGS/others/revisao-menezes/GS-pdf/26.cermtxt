Ticality, the attributes of a software project can be varied. Some projects
he Indian software industry is characterized by the diversity of the
projects it engenders. From size to complexity and from scope to critare
big, encompassing numerous resources with complex integration
and interorganizational developmental processes, whereas others are relatively
small and simple. Some have a worldwide reach, whereas some may
affect only a small division or client group (Keil, Tiwana, & Bush, 2002). Some
software projects are developed “in-house,” whereas others may be outsourced.
Regardless of the size, complexity, criticality, or scope, the success
of software projects is not guaranteed. There is strong evidence to suggest an
unacceptably high rate of software project failure in the software industry. A
large number of projects are abandoned before completion or are completed
after comprising on quality, cost, budget, or all three (Standish Group,
2009).
There has been a wide range of studies conducted, which have addressed
issues pertaining to software projects: their success, their failure, the efficiency
of the team handling them, and the organizational climate in which
they are developed. Various studies (Anudhe & Mathew, 2009; Bannerman,
2008; Boehm, 1989; Costa, Barros, & Travassos, 2007; Dash & Dash, 2010;
Dey, Kinch, & Ogunlana, 2007; Keil, Smith, Pawlowski, & Jin, 2004; Oz &
Sosik, 2000; Ropponen & Lyytinen, 2000) have been conducted in the past to
unveil the reasons for the high rates of delays and failures in the software
industry. Miscommunication of requirements, inaccurate estimations, low
team member morale, lack of client ownership, and lack of top management
support are some of the risk factors that have been mentioned by most of the
researchers, thus emphasizing the technical, managerial, and people
aspects. Nonetheless, it cannot be said with the utmost confidence as to
what extent and magnitude these factors affect the success or failure of the
software project, nor can it be stated how many of these factors genuinely
affect the success or failure of the software project. The reason for this vagueness
is simple: these factors are merely products of the wide variety of
perceptions of the software practitioners who actually handle these factors
during the software development life cycle. A different hierarchical level will
produce a different perception; a different span of experience will lead to a
different perception; and a different project attribute will create a different
perception. Thus, it is a fact that the perception toward these factors varies
widely in the experience and designation of the software practitioners, as
well as the duration, team size, and value of the project. The question now is:
The success of software projects is quite subjective
in nature and is fettered by many risks,
the perception of which varies from individual to
individual and largely depends on the demographic
characteristics of the executives and
even the characteristics of the project. This
study aims to identify and gauge the software
risk dimensions and analyze the differences of
perception among executives toward software
risks. The contributions of this study untangle
the issues underlying risks in the software
industry and associates these issues with the
perception of the “human” factor present in
the industry.

Research Methodology
A systematic and coherent approach
was adopted for the research study.
First and foremost, a pilot study was
done on 40 software project managers
working in software companies located
in the National Capital Region (India)
to gauge the risk factors that affected
the success of their last executed projects.
The project managers in the pilot
study were specifically asked to identify
the critical risk factors affecting the
software development life cycle. Based
on the perceptions of the project managers
in the pilot study and in-depth
secondary data analysis, an exhaustive
list of 23 risk items affecting the software
development life cycle was identified.
These items were meticulously
drawn out after thorough interviews
and a comprehensive literature review;
thus, the list is all-inclusive. A questionnaire
was prepared using these risk
items and was administered to software
professionals with a minimum of four
years' experience in handling software
projects in India.
To carry out extensive research, a
survey design was used. Four major IT
hubs in India-namely, NCR (Gurgaon,
Noida, Delhi, Faridabad), Hyderabad,
Bangalore, and Chennai-were selected.
From each IT hub, eight companies
were randomly selected, thus bringing
the total to 32 companies. A total of 900
questionnaires were sent out, of which
340 filled-in questionnaires were
returned, with a response rate of 37.7
percent; of these, only 300 were found

and grouped together according to
the cumulative frequencies in such a
way that each group has almost equal
distribution. Table 2 provides the
demographic characteristics.
Analysis and Findings
The analysis of the data set obtained
was conducted in several steps. First,
the major software risk dimensions
were identified using principal component
analysis (PCA). PCA is widely used
to examine the underlying patterns for
a large number of variables and to
determine if the information can be
summarized in a small set of factors or
components for subsequent correlation
or regression. Second, ANOVA-Duncan
post-hoc was conducted to test the
variance in these dimensions among
various demographics and project
characteristics. The reliability of the
survey instrument was also tested.
Designation
Because the questionnaire was deliberately
administered to IT professionals
with more than four years of experience
handling software projects, the respondents
were primarily project leads and
higher-level employees. As shown in
Table 2, out of 300 respondents, 141 (47
percent) were primarily project managers,
senior managers, and account
managers, who were specified as Level

finally, the approximate value of the

provided in Table 3.
Team Size
The total team size was divided into
three categories. As is clear from Table
3, 100 projects were handled by a team
size of three to ten members, whereas
89 projects were handled by a team
size of 11 to 20 members; thus, 189 (63
percent) projects handled by the
respondents had a team of 20 members
or less. On the higher side, only 25
projects (8.4 percent) had a team ranging
from 50 to almost 500. Only one
project had a total value of US $145
million, with a team size of 500 team
members.
Total Experience
As shown in Table 2, the respondents
were classified into three categories,
depending on their total experience.
The second category (123 respondents
[41 percent]) was dominated by project
managers and senior project managers,
with total experience ranging
from 10 to 14 years. A few directors and
vice presidents were also in this category.
In the last category, with more
than 14 years of experience, there were
65 (21.7 percent) respondents, mainly
from the senior management team. A
few senior managers and account
managers fell under this category. The
main reason for this blend is that the
software industry is a modern industry,
and consists of 25- to 30-year-old individuals
who can start their own businesses
and hire their own employees;
therefore, it is easier to reach higher
levels at an early age compared with
the traditional industries (e.g., iron and
steel).

As shown in Table 3, the projects were
almost evenly distributed among the
three groups, with most of the projects
falling into either the first group of project
value (up to US $70,000) or the third
group (value above US $2 million).
However, after a detailed analysis, it
was found that most of the projects

Researchers even state that project
managers fail to make correct estimations
in the initial stages of the software
development and sometimes distort
the facts or become too optimistic, thus
creating gross estimation errors (Keil,

crucial it is to understand the requirements
correctly for the success of the
project.
Identification of the Risk
Dimensions
As already pointed out, the 23 risk items
used for the study were identified after
an all-encompassing and exhaustive
secondary data analysis and pilot study.
Table 4 describes the 23 risk items used
for the study.
Factor analysis was done to extract
the software risk factors affecting the
success of the projects; principal component
analysis was the method of
extraction and Varimax was the rotation
method. As per the Kaiser criterion,
only factors with eigenvalues greater
than 1 were retained. Four factors in the
initial solution have eigenvalues greater
than 1; together, they account for
almost 68% of the variability in the original
variables. The items falling under
each of these factors were then dealt
with quite prudently. The factors
extracted for the study are shown in
Table 5.

studies and also conforms to studies by
Sherer (1995), Pan (1999), Krasner (1998),
and Ropponen and Lyytinen (2000).
Ranking of Software Risk Dimensions
For determining the most important
risk affecting the software projects in
India, means and standard deviations
of the risk dimensions were calculated.
The respondents were asked to rate the
effect of each risk based on the success of
their last executed project, on a scale
of 1 to 5, in which 5 was too much effect
and 1 was no effect at all. After the factor
analysis, when four factors
emerged, the score of each of the factors
was computed by taking out the
mean of the items falling under each
factor. For example, in order to calculate
the mean of dependability, the
scores of all the items (i.e., third-party
dependencies, inability to meet specifications,
and inadequate measurement
tools for reliability) were first added,
and then the mean was calculated.
Similarly, means and standard deviations
were calculated for all the factors.
The ranking of the dimensions, based
on the means and standard deviations,
is shown in Table 6.
It is clear from Table 6 that SRS variability
has the highest mean of 3.06,
stating that most of the respondents
consider software requirement specification
variability as the most important
risk affecting software projects. The
standard deviation for SRS variability
risk is 1.06. The SRS variability risk is
closely followed by dependability risk,
with a mean of 2.84; team composition
risk, with a mean of 2.75; and, finally,
control processes risk, with a mean of
2.52, thus, clearly proving that SRS variability
risk is the most important risk
affecting Indian software projects,
which is also in line with the findings of
Sharma, Gupta, and Khilnani (2009).
Although SRS variability risk is perceived
to be the most crucial risk, is
the perception the same across all the
groups of designation and experience?

Comparison of Risk Factors
Across Various Personal and
Project Characteristics
The dimensions of software risk so formulated
after the factor analysis were
then compared with the various personal
characteristics of the respondents
and the project characteristics handled
by the respondents chosen for the
study. The personal characteristics
included experience and designation,
whereas project characteristics included
total team size, total time taken to
complete the project, and the total
value of the project. The comparisons
are discussed in the following section.
Designation
Duncan's Mean Test was applied to
compare the dimensions of software
risk among the three designation
groups of the respondents. All risk
dimensions-namely, SRS variability,
team composition, control processes,
and dependability-showed significant
differences in mean and standard deviation
values. Table 7 shows all the values
of mean and standard deviations of
the dimensions of software risk across the
various designation groups.
As shown in Table 7, the F-value is
highest in cases of SRS variability. This
factor has been ranked the highest by
respondents of level 1 (project leads,
technical leads, consultants, and analysts),
with a mean of 3.58 and a standard
deviation of 0.87, which implies
that level 1 respondents perceive these
risks as having a high effect on the success
of the project. Dependability and
team composition risks, with means of
3.26 and 3.19, respectively, are again
considered more significant risks by
level 1 respondents than the other two
groups, which are dominated by project
managers (level 2) and directors (level
3). This is due to the lack of sufficient
experience, expertise, and authority in
handling and mitigating risks. Another
interesting fact that emerged out of the
analysis was that the difference was significant
only with level 1. It should be
noted here that there were no significant
differences between level 2 and
level 3 respondents, thus testifying that
these two levels have an almost similar
opinion. When compared with level 1
employees, both these groups showed
significant difference. Hence, it can be
said with statistical confidence that
there exists a difference in perception
of these risks among the various designation
groups, which conforms to
many other previous studies. Stephen
et al. (2007) testified that IT project
managers with more experience have
risk perceptions that differ from those
of more junior managers. Warkentin
et al. (2009) has also concluded that,
instead of viewing risks as separate or
discrete categories, managers at higher
levels, owing to their more comprehensive
organizational perspectives, are
more likely to consider risks essentially
organizational in nature compared
with their junior managers. The same
has been reiterated by Smith, Eastcroft,
Mahmood, and Rode (2006).
Total Experience
Duncan's Mean Test was applied to
compare the dimensions of software
risk among three groups and formed on
the basis of total experience. Significant
differences were found in the mean values
of all of the dimensions of risk.
Table 8 shows all the values of mean
and standard deviations of the dimensions
of risk across the various experience
groups. As shown, the F-value was
highest in the case of SRS variability,
followed by team composition, control
processes, and dependability. It should

be noted again that the difference was
significant only between two groups
(i.e., between E1 [up to 9 years of experience]
and E2 [10 to 14 years of experience]
and E1 and E3 [more than 14
years of experience]). E2 and E3 had no
significant differences between them as
far as the perceptions of these four risk
factors were concerned.
All four risks were ranked highest by
E1 respondents, followed by E2, and
then E3. This is not surprising, because
employees with less experience are not
as well versed in managing such issues
or even mitigating them, compared
with veterans in the industry for whom
such issues do not emerge as risks but
as minor challenges that need to be
faced and dealt with. Respondents in
the E2 and E3 categories, therefore,
have similar opinions about such risks,
and so there is no significant difference
between the two. This finding also has
congruence with earlier studies, such
as those by Bourne and Walker (2004),
Smith et al. (2006), and Warkentin et al.
(2009), in which it was concluded that
employees with more experience in
project leadership were more likely to
view projects and their associated risks
more holistically and assign and resolve
risks as if they were organizational in
nature.

and Warkentin et al. (2009) have pointed
out that considering the time issue
of a project, the team relationships
have to be managed. As quoted in
Warkentin et al. (2009), “Ultimately you
need effective communication channels
with your vendors and technology
partners. Mutual respect and understanding
play a large role in the relationship”
(p. 14). This clearly states
that team composition is associated
with the duration of a project and that it
has a larger impact on projects with
longer durations as compared with shorter
ones.
Total Monetary Value
Money is a critical resource that should
be allocated and monitored for the success
of software and information systems
development projects (Laudise &
Nuara, 2002; Warkentin et al., 2009).
The total dollar value thus becomes an
important attribute for any project, and
it has been selected for comparing the
risk factors. The total dollar values of
projects in which the respondents were
involved are divided into three categories-namely,
V1 (up to US $0.70 million),
V2 (US $0.71-2.00 million), and V3
(more than $2.00 million). As shown in
Table 11, Duncan's Mean Test was
applied to see if there were any differences
in the mean values of the risk factors
among the three categories of
dollar values associated with the last
executed projects; it was determined
that none of the differences was significant.
Thus, it cannot be said with statistical
confidence that there exists a
difference in the mean value of the risk
factors across the three categories of
project value.
Thus, it is clear how each of the software
risk dimensions is viewed by the
various stakeholders within the software
development organization. Rather
than viewing many software risks as
separate or discrete categories, senior
project managers, with their more
comprehensive organizational perspectives,
view all risks as essentially
organizational in nature, compared
with the perspectives of the project
leads and technical leads. As far as the
variance in risk dimensions among the
project characteristics is concerned,
the analysis did not show significant
variance among most of the project
characteristics. The team composition
risk, however, did show a significant
variance among the large-size projects,
which is also in line with the findings of
Ropponen and Lyytinen (2000).
Conclusion, Limitations, and
Implications
To conclude, it can be said that based on
the perceptions of software executivesranging
from middle to top levelprimarily
four kinds of risk dimensions
