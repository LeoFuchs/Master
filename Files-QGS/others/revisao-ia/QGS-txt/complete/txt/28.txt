Abstract
Background: Synthesis of data from published human genetic association studies is a critical step
in  the  translation  of  human  genome  discoveries  into  health  applications.  Although  genetic
association  studies  account  for  a  substantial  proportion  of  the  abstracts  in  PubMed,  identifying
them with standard queries is not always accurate or efficient. Further automating the literature-
screening  process  can  reduce  the  burden  of  a  labor-intensive  and  time-consuming  traditional
literature  search.  The  Support  Vector  Machine  (SVM),  a  well-established  machine  learning
technique, has been successful in classifying text, including biomedical literature. The GAPscreener,
a free SVM-based software tool, can be used to assist in screening PubMed abstracts for human
genetic association studies.
Results: The data source for this research was the HuGE Navigator, formerly known as the HuGE
Pub Lit database. Weighted SVM feature selection based on a keyword list obtained by the two-
way z score method demonstrated the best screening performance, achieving 97.5% recall, 98.3%
specificity and 31.9% precision in performance testing. Compared with the traditional screening
process based on a complex PubMed query, the SVM tool reduced by about 90% the number of
abstracts requiring individual review by the database curator. The tool also ascertained 47 articles
that were missed by the traditional literature screening process during the 4-week test period. We
examined the literature on genetic associations with preterm birth as an example. Compared with
the traditional, manual process, the GAPscreener both reduced effort and improved accuracy.
Conclusion:  GAPscreener  is  the  first  free  SVM-based  application  available  for  screening  the
human genetic association literature in PubMed with high recall and specificity. The user-friendly
graphical  user  interface  makes  this  a  practical,  stand-alone  application.  The  software  can  be
downloaded at no charge.

Background
The peer-reviewed scientific literature is a major source of
information for developing research hypotheses and cre-
ating new knowledge through synthesis of research find-
ings [1]. The information explosion in biomedical science
has created a huge challenge for researchers, who want to
obtain  useful  information  promptly  and  efficiently.
Human  genetic  association  studies  epitomize  this  chal-
lenge because they have proliferated rapidly since comple-
tion of the Human Genome Project [2]. Systematic review
and meta-analysis have become important approaches for
evaluating the robustness of such associations across dif-
ferent study platforms and populations [3]. A key factor in
the quality of a systematic review is complete capture of
the  relevant  studies  [4].  Many  databases  that  deposit
genetic association information, including citations from
PubMed, have been built and curated [5-7]. PubMed [8] is
the largest publicly accessible biomedical literature data-
base and is the main source for such activities. However,
because of its large size and the complex syntax required
for  query  formation,  it  is  fairly  difficult  to  comprehen-
sively and effectively search PubMed for genetic associa-
tion studies. The necessarily labor-intensive screening and
curation  process  makes  the  maintenance  of  such  data-
bases extremely challenging.

Automatic  literature  classification  is  becoming  increas-
ingly attractive and has already demonstrated some suc-
cesses  in  the  biomedical  literature  [9-12].  The  support
vector machine (SVM) method [13] is a powerful machine
learning technique that has been used to solve classifica-
tion  problems  [14-18].  An  earlier  report  described  a
potential application of SVM methods to classify literature
on human genome epidemiology [10]. In this paper, we
report a novel method for feature selection and show that
using it to train the SVM model significantly improved its
ability  to  classify  reports  of  human  genetic  association
studies.  We  implemented  the  method  as  a  Java-based
application  named  GAPscreener  (Genetic  Association
Publication screener) that can be freely downloaded [19].

Implementation
SVM Model Generation
Data sources
To generate the training dataset for the SVM experiment,
we used 10,000 randomly selected abstracts from articles
published between 2001 and 2006 in PubMed as a back-
ground dataset. The positive dataset consisted of 10,000
randomly selected gene-disease association articles from
the  HuGE  Navigator  [5]  (formerly  known  as  the  HuGE
Pub Lit database [6]), a continuously updated database of
studies  relevant  to  human  genome  epidemiology  spon-
sored by the National Office of Public Health Genomics.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria for positive dataset from
the HuGE Pub Lit database has been reported [6].

PubMed abstract text retrieval
We  developed  a  PubMed  text  extraction  tool  using  the
NCBI  E-utility  [20]  to  retrieve  text  content  based  on
PubMed  identification  numbers  (PMIDs).  The  text  used
for processing consisted of the title and the abstract, or the
title alone if the abstract was not available. The text data
were stored in a data structure for processing.

Text processing and extraction of keywords
The abstract and title of each article were then processed
with the text-processing tool we developed. A stemming
technique  was  used  to  deal  with  morphologic  word
changes,  for  example,  polymorph(isms)  and  poly-
morph(ic) were considered the same word. A stop word
list was generated for some common English words, such
as pronouns and articles, to reduce the number of words
extracted.

Significant keyword generation
We  selected  keywords  by  identifying  statistically  signifi-
cant  differences  between  the  probability  of  their  occur-
rence  in  the  text  (title  and  abstract)  of  human  genetic
association articles, compared with their frequency in all
other articles. The sample sizes of both groups were large
enough that the distribution of differences in probabili-
ties  was  approximated  by  a  normal  distribution.  Thus
words with a z score greater than 1.96 or less than – 1.96
(significance level of α = .05) were chosen as feature key-
words.

The statistical formula [21] used for calculating the z score
is given by:

Generating SVM input data
The  statistically  significant  keywords  are  called  feature
keywords  and  were  used  to  construct  the  SVM  features.
Each  feature  keyword  was  weighted  according  to  its  z
score, normalized to values from -1 to +1. For the training
and testing data sets, the script generated the SVM input
based  on  sparse  format  [22].  The  presence  of  each  key-
word was represented by its position on the feature key-
word list, followed by a colon and the normalized z score;
the absence of keywords was ignored and each feature was
separated  by  a  space,  for  example,  1:0.003589  30:-
0.81189. In the training data set, the first column of the
input data was set to the known outcome, i.e., 1 for posi-
tive, -1 for negative. In the test set, the first column of the
input dataset was set to 0.

Two sets of significant keywords were generated. One set
contained those with positive z scores above the threshold
(1.96) (called one-way weighted scheme); the other con-
tained key words with both positive (greater than 1.96)
and  negative  z  scores  (less  than  -1.96)  (called  two-way
weighted scheme).

SVM model training
We  used  LibSVM  [22],  a  freely  available  SVM  software
library, to train the SVM model. The accompanying utility,
grid.py, was used to find optimum parameters for penalty
parameter C and gamma in the radial basis function (RBF)
kernel. The RBF kernel was chosen based on its potential
in terms of performance [23].

Stand-alone Application Implementation
GAPscreener  is  a  stand-alone  application  built  with  the
Java programming language. Java Swing [24] components
were used to build the graphical user interface (GUI). The
application incorporates open-source LibSVM Java codes
for  prediction,  employing  the  SVM  model  we  trained.
Java-based Web services in the NCBI E-utility were used to
query and retrieve PubMed records. EzInstall [25], a free-
ware  application,  was  used  to  package  the  application
with  a  Java  Runtime  Environment  (JRE),  for  automatic,
self-contained installation.

Performance Evaluation
General performance evaluation
To  evaluate  the  performance  of  the  screening  tool,  we
used a series of new test data (not included in the training
set). The first test data set (92253 negatives, 773 positives)
consisted of selections from PubMed during five consecu-
tive weeks (February 22, 2007 to March 22, 2007) accord-
ing  to  the  routine,  traditional  screening  process  used  to
build the HuGE Navigator [5]. Positive or negative status
assigned by the routine process was considered the gold
standard. We used this data set to evaluate two keyword
weighting schemes. A second data set (68255 negatives,

597 positives), selected from PubMed during four subse-
quent weeks (April 5, 2007 to April 26, 2007), was used
to  evaluate  false-positive  results  generated  by  the  GAP-
screener using the selected weighting scheme.

Recall, specificity and precision were calculated from the
test data to evaluate the performance of the application.
The formulas for calculating these parameters are as fol-
lows:

where  TP,  TN,  FP  and  FN  represent  the  number  of  true
positive,  true  negative,  false  positive  and  false  negative
results, respectively.

To compare the results of classification by the SVM tool
with the gold standard, we used logistic regression (SAS
Version 9.13, SAS Institute, Cary, NC). We produced sep-
arate logistic regression models for results of the one-way
and two-way SVM schemes during the 5-week experiment
(February 22, 2007 to March 28, 2007). Results from each
model were used to generate receiver-operating character-
istics (ROC) and calculate the area under the curve (AUC)
with 95% confidence intervals. The AUC of ROC curves
for the two models were compared using nonparametric
methods [26,27].

Domain-specific performance evaluation
A  list  of  articles  compiled  independently  by  domain
experts was used as the gold standard to evaluate the pre-
dictive  accuracy  of  the  application.  A  network  of  eight
experts in the analysis of genetic associations with preterm
birth  performed  a  comprehensive  literature  search  to
build a knowledge base for systematic review and meta-
analysis. The search was limited to articles published from
January 1, 1990, to April 12, 2007. Complex queries com-
piled  by  a  librarian  were  used  to  query  PubMed  and
EMBASE [28]. The complex queries consisted of sophisti-
cated PubMed and EMBASE syntax filling more than four
single-spaced pages. The results were manually reviewed
by the domain experts.

For  comparison,  we  used  the  GAPscreener  to  screen  all
PubMed  abstracts  published  during  the  same  period  of
time  in  a  two-step  process.  First,  we  compiled  a  broad
PubMed  query  based  on  common  terms  related  to  pre-
term birth. The 42,585 PubMed abstracts returned by this
query were then classified by the SVM tool.

Results
SVM feature selection
We  generated  a  list  of  significant  keywords  using  the  z
score method, based on comparing their relative frequen-
cies in 10,000 general PubMed abstracts and 10,000 gene
disease-associated abstracts included in the HuGE Pub Lit
database.  The  one-way  and  two-way  weighted  schemes
generated lists of 1,301 and 4,589 keywords, respectively.
Normalized  z  scores  between  1  and  -1  were  used  as
weighting parameters for each keyword.

The two-way weighted scheme (using keywords with pos-
itive and negative z scores) performed better than the one-
way  scheme  in  terms  of  recall,  specificity  and  precision
(Table 1). The AUC for the two-way scheme was signifi-
cantly larger than for the one-way scheme (p < 0.0001).

Using the SVM tool for HuGE Pub Lit database screening 
and curation
The  routine  screening  process  used  to  perform  weekly
updates  of  the  HuGE  Pub  Lit  database  was  based  on  a
complex query that combined Medical Subject Headings
(MeSH)  terms  and  selected  text  words,  followed  by  a
labor-intensive, time-consuming manual review by a sin-
gle curator (MC) [5]. Because a previous evaluation had
concluded that the recall of this process was about 80%
[5],  we  re-evaluated  the  SVM  false  positives  and  found
that  the  SVM  was  able  to  pick  up  47  positive  articles
missed by the traditional curation process during the 4-
week  evaluation  period;  however,  14  positive  abstracts
were missed by the SVM (Table 2).

The number of abstracts returned by the query is a crucial
factor  in  determining  the  burden  of  curating  the  HuGE
Navigator  database.  The  ever-increasing  number  of
genetic  association  studies  –  combined  with  curator
fatigue – may also influence the quality of the database.
Our  4-week  experiment  showed  that  using  the  GAP-
screener reduced the number of abstracts requiring man-
ual review approximately 8-fold (Table 3).

Screening PubMed for genetic associations with preterm 
birth
We built this application not only for general screening of
the PubMed literature on genetic associations but also as
a tool that could be customized for searching genetic asso-
ciation literature in any specific domain. We used preterm
birth as an example to evaluate the application's perform-
ance  in  this  setting.  An  independent  screening  process
performed by domain experts first identified 5,421 articles
in  PubMed  and  EMBASE  by  complex  PubMed  and
EMBASE queries. After reviewing each abstract manually,
49 articles were included in the  knowledge base. All 49
articles were recorded in the PubMed database. In a paral-
lel process, the GAPscreener was used to perform the ini-
tial screening automatically with the preterm birth specific
query (see Method), identifying 531 articles. Of these, 47
(96%) overlapped with the set of 49 articles identified by
the domain experts. The GAPscreener missed two articles
found by the traditional process but picked up six addi-
tional articles that the traditional process had missed (Fig-
ure 1).

Implementation of the user-friendly application
The GAPscreener includes all components in the screen-
ing process: PubMed record retrieval from NCBI, text con-
tent  processing  for  keyword  extraction,  SVM  input  data
formatting,  and  SVM  output  display  and  record  export
(Figure  2).  A  graphical  user  interface  (GUI)  provides  a
user-friendly environment (Figure 3). The application can

Discussion
The  number  of  published  genetic  associations  has
exploded during the past decade [6]. Finding these associ-
ations in major online databases like PubMed is critical
for establishing the knowledge base on genetic factors in
specific diseases [7]. Automated tools are needed to help
scientists cope with the information overload. For 6 years,
the  HuGE  Pub  Lit  database  has  continuously  collected
PubMed literature related to human genome epidemiol-
ogy, providing a great opportunity to test machine learn-
ing techniques for automating the screening process [28].
Compared with the existing, traditional screening process,
the GAPscreener dramatically reduced the burden of man-
ual  review  and  substantially  improved  screening  recall,
from 80% to 97.5%.

Feature selection is an important element of the support
vector machine technique. Our weighted z score method
performed  better  than  a  previously  reported  method
based  on  the  Term  Frequency  ×  Inverse  Document  Fre-
quency (TFIDF) weighting scheme [10]. Representing sta-
tistical information for each keyword as a normalized z
score (value between 1 and -1) performed better than the
binary representation [10].

As  we  demonstrated  in  the  example  of  preterm  birth,  a
potentially  important  application  of  the  GAPscreener  is
identifying  genetic  association  literature  in  a  specific
domain  (e.g.,  disease,  gene,  or  pathway).  This  could  be
very useful to disease-specific networks or consortia, such
as those that have banded together in a global HuGENet
collaboration  [30].  The  GAPscreener  takes  advantage  of
PubMed  search  capacity  to  narrow  down  the  returned

The GAPscreener could become a routine screening tool
for  researchers  and  database  curators  for  maintaining  a
local reference database. The tool can be downloaded at
no charge and source code is available upon request. It is
a freeware search tool that can assist researchers with sys-
tematic  reviews  by  identifying  genetic  association  litera-
ture in PubMed in a user-friendly and sensitive way. To
our  knowledge,  it  is  the  first  free  application  that  uses
SVM techniques to classify published literature related to
human  genetic  association  studies.  Certainly,  a  similar
approach could be used to classify literature in other bio-
medical fields.

Although the GAPscreener demonstrated high recall and
specificity,  it  has  many  aspects  that  could  be  improved.
For example, the two-way weighted z score scheme based
on a threshold of ± 1.96 generated 4,589 keywords. The
number  of  featured  keywords  influences  the  processing
speed, which in this example averaged about 0.02 second
per abstract. We are planning to experiment with shorter
featured keyword lists to improve processing time without
sacrificing recall.

The keyword approach is only one of many ways to trans-
form text into a feature vector. Use of controlled vocabu-
laries  can  make  "keywords"  more  meaningful  and
condense the list by reducing synonyms for a particular
concept to a single term. The Unified Medical Language
System  (UMLS)  sponsored  by  the  National  Library  of
Medicine provides a central repository for standard con-
trolled vocabularies in the biomedical fields [31]. Meta-
Map  Transfer  (MMTx)  is  a  tool  that  maps  free  text  to
