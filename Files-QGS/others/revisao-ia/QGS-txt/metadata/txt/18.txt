Title: Classifying Biomedical Abstracts Using Committees of Classifiers and Collective Ranking Techniques

Keywords: Machine Learning, Automatic Text Classification, Systematic Reviews, Ranking Algorithms.

Abstract: 
The purpose of this work is to reduce the workload of human experts in building systematic reviews from published articles, used in evidence-based medicine. We propose to use a committee of classifiers to rank biomedical abstracts based on the predicted relevance to the topic under review. In our approach, we identify two subsets of abstracts: one that represents the top, and another that represents the bottom of the ranked list. These subsets, identified using machine learning (ML) techniques, are considered zones where abstracts are labeled with high confidence as relevant or irrelevant to the topic of the review. Early experiments with this approach using different classifiers and different representation techniques show significant workload reduction.
