Naive Architecting - Understanding the Reasoning Process of Students

Software architecting entails making architecture decisions, which requires a lot of experience and expertise. Current literature contains several methods and processes to support architects with architecture design, documentation and evaluation but not with the design reasoning involved in decision-making. In order to derive a systematic reasoning process we need to understand the current state of practice and propose ways to improve it. In this paper we present the results of a survey that was conducted with undergraduate software engineering students, aiming to find out the innate reasoning process during architect- ing. The results of the survey are compared to the existing architecture literature in order to identify promising directions towards systematic reasoning processes
