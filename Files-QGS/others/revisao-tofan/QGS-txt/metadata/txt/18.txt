Customer Value in Architecture Decision Making

This paper focuses on the business aspects of architecture decision making â€“ in particular how to quantify the customer value of quality improvements to support architecture investment decisions. We developed concepts for quantifying the impact of quality improvements on customer value, customer value-in-use, and customer segments. In two real-life case studies we present (1) how the concept for quantifying customer value was used, (2) how the customer value relates to the existing value indicators in the organization, and (3) how the importance of customer value for architecture decision making was assessed by practitioners in the organization.
