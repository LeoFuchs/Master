Reducing Architectural Knowledge Vaporization by Applying the Repertory Grid Technique

The architecture of a software-intensive system is the composition of architectural design decisions. These decisions are an important part of Architectural Knowledge (AK). Failure to document architectural design decisions can lead to AK vaporization and higher maintenance costs. To reduce AK vaporization, we propose to apply the Repertory Grid Technique (RGT) to make tacit knowledge about architecture decisions explicit. An architect can use the RGT to elicit decision alternatives and concerns, and to rank each alternative against concerns. To validate our approach, we conducted a survey with graduate students. In the survey, participants documented decisions using the RGT. We compared these decisions with decisions documented using a basic decision template. Our results suggest that RGT leads to less AK vaporization, compared to conventional ways of documenting decisions.
