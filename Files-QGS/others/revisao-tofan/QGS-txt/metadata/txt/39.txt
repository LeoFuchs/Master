Capturing Architecture Evolution with Maps of Architectural Decisions 2.0

Modern IT systems evolve being re-architected throughout their entire lifetime. Existing architecture decision-making approaches are oriented towards systems design, rather than systems evolution. However, real-life architecture evolution is substantially different to initial architectural design. It is a disorderly process, in most cases unrepeatable, and therefore difficult to be put into a predefined rut as most approaches try to do. MAD 2.0 model has been developed to support architect-practitioners working on systems evolution. It does not impose any predefined classification or hierarchy of architectural decisions and assumes a limited number of kinds of relations between architectural decisions. This makes a model of the decision process intuitive and easy to comprehend. To explain the choices made and capture their rationale, the entire decision situation is presented, including: the decision topic, considered design options, relevant requirements, and the advantages and
disadvantages of every considered option. The proposed models and approach, supported by an appropriate modelling tool, has been validated in the real life conditions of one of the telecom companies.
