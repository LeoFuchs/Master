Software Architecture as a Set of Architectural Design Decisions

Software architectures have high costs for change, are complex, and erode during evolution. We believe these problems are partially due to knowledge vaporization. Currently, almost all the knowledge and information about the design decisions the architecture is based on are implicitly embedded in the architecture, but lack a first-class repre- sentation. Consequently, knowledge about these design decisions disappears into the architecture, which leads to the aforementioned problems. In this paper, a new perspective on software architecture is presented, which views software architecture as a composition ofa set ofexplicit design decisions. This perspective makes architectural design deci- sions an explicit part of a software architecture. Consequently, knowledge vaporization is reduced, thereby alleviating some ofthe fundamental problems ofsoftware architecture.
