Donâ€™t Install Software by Hand

An IT system's setup and configuration affects developers mainly due to the proliferation and complexity of Internet-facing systems. Fortunately, we can control and conquer this complexity by adopting IT-system configuration management tools. By stipulating that all modifications to a system's configuration can only be performed through its configuration management system and by treating the system's rules as code, an organization ensures that the IT systems it delivers to its clients are not inscrutable monoliths that just happen to work but documented modular engines that work by design.
