Toward an OSGi-Based infrastructure for context-aware applications

Applications and services must adapt to changing contexts in dynamic environments. This OSGi-based infrastructure manages context-aware services reliably and securely and efficiently supports context acquisition, discovery, and reasoning. A formal, ontology-based context model enables semantic context representation, reasoning, and knowledge sharing.
