API usage pattern recommendation for software development
Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) facilitate pragmatic reuse and improve the productivity of software development.
An API usage pattern documents a set of method calls from multiple API classes to achieve a reusable functionality.
Existing approaches often use frequent-sequence mining to extract API usage patterns.
However, as reported by earlier studies, frequent-sequence mining may not produce a complete set of usage patterns.
In this paper, we explore the possibility of mining API usage patterns without relying on frequent-pattern mining.
Our approach represents the source code as a network of object usages where an object usage is a set of method calls invoked on a single API class.
We automatically extract usage patterns by clustering the data based on the co-existence relations between object usages.
We conduct an empirical study using a corpus of 11,510 Android applications.
The results demonstrate that our approach can effectively mine API usage patterns with high completeness and low redundancy.
We observe 18% and 38% improvement on F-measure and response time respectively comparing to usage pattern extraction using frequent-sequence mining.
