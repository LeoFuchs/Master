Title: Using Classifier Performance Visualization to Improve Collective Ranking Techniques for Biomedical Abstracts Classification

Keywords: Machine Learning, Automatic Text Classification, Systematic Reviews, Ranking Algorithms, Scientific Visualization

Abstract: 
The purpose of this work is to improve on the selection of algorithms for classifier committees applied to reducing the workload of human experts in building systematic reviews used in evidence-based medicine. We focus on clustering pre-selected classifiers based on a multi-measure prediction performance evaluation expressed in terms of a projection from a high-dimensional space to a visualizable two-dimensional one. The best classifier was selected from each cluster and included in the committee. We applied the
committee of classifiers to rank biomedical abstracts based on the predicted relevance to the topic under review. We identified a subset of abstracts that represents the bottom of the ranked list (predicted as irrelevant). We used False Negatives (relevant articles mistakenly ranked at the bottom) as a final performance measure. Our early experiments demonstrate that the classifier committee built using our new approach outperformed committees of classifiers arbitrary created from the same list of pre-selected classifiers.
