Title: A Visual Text Mining approach for Systematic Reviews

Keywords:

Abstract: 
The software engineering research community has been adopting systematic reviews as an unbiased and fair way to assess a research topic. Despite encouraging early results, a systematic review process can be time consuming and hard to conduct. Thus, tools that help on its planning or execution are needed. This article suggests the use of Visual
Text Mining (VTM) to aid systematic reviews. A feasibility study was conducted comparing the proposed approach with a manual process. We observed that VTM can con-
tribute to Systematic Review and we propose a new strategy called VTM-Based Systematic Review.
