Objective: To determine whether SVM-based classiﬁers, which are trained on a combination of inclusion
and common exclusion articles, are useful to experts reviewing journal articles for inclusion during new
systematic reviews.
Methods: Test collections were built using the annotated reference ﬁles from 19 procedure and 4 drug
systematic reviews. The classiﬁers were trained by balanced data sets, which were sampled using random
sampling. This approach compared two balanced data sets, one with a combination of included and com-
monly excluded articles and one with a combination of included and excluded articles. AUCs were used as
evaluation metrics.
Results: The AUCs of the classiﬁers, which were trained on the balanced data set with included and com-
monly excluded articles, were signiﬁcantly higher than those of the classiﬁers, which were trained on the
balanced data set with included and excluded articles.
Conclusion: Automatic, high-quality article classiﬁers using machine learning could reduce the workload
of experts performing systematic reviews when topic-speciﬁc data are scarce. In particular, when used as
training data, a combination of included and commonly excluded articles is more helpful than a combi-
nation of included and excluded articles.

1. Introduction

Evidence-based medicine (EBM), the philosophical origins of
which extend back to mid-19th century Paris and earlier, is the
conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of the current best evi-
dence in making decisions regarding individual patient care [1].
EBM is an important development in clinical practice and scholarly
research because this approach aims to provide better care with
better outcomes through referring clinical decisions mainly on so-
lid scientiﬁc evidence [2]. Because EBM directly applies the knowl-
edge gained from large clinical trials to patient care, it promotes
consistency in individual patient treatments, optimal clinical out-
comes and quality of life [3]. The practice of EBM integrates indi-
vidual clinical expertise with the best available external clinical
evidence from systematic research.

Systematic review (SR) plays a key role in EBM [4] and attempts
to identify, appraise, and synthesize all empirical evidence that
meets the pre-speciﬁed eligibility criteria to answer a given ques-
tion [5]. SR is processed in four distinct steps [6]. In the ﬁrst step,
the review topic and key questions are deﬁned; then, all relevant
studies are retrieved from a number of different databases, such
as MEDLINE and EMBASE. In the second, experts select the re-
trieved abstracts that are most likely to meet the inclusion criteria

(abstract triage step). In the next step, the experts closely read the
selected articles, classify the articles as inclusion or exclusion in
the SR using pre-speciﬁed eligibility criteria (full text triage step),
and assess quality of inclusion articles. Finally, if included articles
are sufﬁciently similar, their results are synthesized.

The new Health Technology Assessment (nHTA) center in the
National Evidence-based Healthcare Collaborating Agency assesses
new medical technologies introduced into Korean healthcare mar-
kets. It evaluates the safety and effectiveness of new medical tech-
nologies in real clinical settings.
It systematically reviews all
evidence relevant to the evaluation of those technologies. To date,
126 evidence reports have been completed and published [7].

The scientiﬁc literature is growing extremely fast (500,000 new
abstracts are added to Medline every year), but only a minority of
trials have been suggested in SRs [4,8]. The Cochrane Collaboration,
which coordinates the creation and update of SRs, estimates that at
least 10,000 reviews are needed to cover a substantial proportion
of the studies relevant to health care [9]. However, creating a
new SR or updating an existing one takes considerable time and ef-
fort. Using current methods, we have not been able to cover new
issues and keep even half of existing reviews up-to-date [10]. We
need to reduce avoidable processes in the production of research
evidence [11]. Advanced information technologies can be devel-
oped and implemented to support SRs by reducing the labor re-
quired while still capturing high-quality evidence [4].

Researchers conducting SRs try to provide a more precise esti-
mate and reduce uncertainty aimed at minimizing bias [5]. To pro-
duce more reliable ﬁndings, they exclude studies having high risk
of biases (i.e., opinion pieces). In this study, we divided exclusion
articles of the SRs into two parts: common and topic-speciﬁc. Com-
mon exclusion articles cannot be included in any SRs, because their
results are deﬁnitely biased. Topic-speciﬁc articles can be included
or excluded in SRs according to the topics. We hypothesize that by
using commonly excluded articles across all SRs, we can automat-
ically classify rigorous articles with better results than previous
works. We propose a method that creates classiﬁers through train-
ing on articles that are included and commonly excluded.

2. Background

To ﬁnd high-quality articles concerning internal medicine,
Aphinyanaphongs and colleagues [2] applied machine learning
(ML) techniques using data derived from the ACP Journal Club.
They used a variety of ML techniques and found that the support
vector machine (SVM) achieved the best performance with those
data. They showed an efﬁcient and improved means for identifying
high-quality articles in internal medicine.

Cohen [12] also applied ML technique to systematic drug class
reviews. They evaluated various feature combinations to classify
rigorous articles based on SVMlight [13]. They showed that the over-
all top scoring combination among three feature combinations was
the combination of unigram and n-gram with a length of 2 ex-
tracted from the title/abstract of MEDLINE and MeSH(Medical Sub-
ject Headings). On the other hand, the lowest scoring combination
was the combination of unigram, MeSH, and UMLS CUI (Uniﬁed
Medical Language System Concept Unique Identiﬁer). Among the
two feature combinations, the combination of unigram and MeSH
showed the best score, and the combination of unigram and UMLS
CUI showed the worst score. They also compared the classiﬁcation
performance of each feature. MeSH performed the best, and UMLS
CUI performed the worst. They concluded that the MeSH feature
was essential for good performance.

Kilicoglu and colleagues [14] evaluated various ML techniques
and feature sets to recognize scientiﬁcally rigorous research evi-
dence. They showed that combining commonly used classiﬁers
(Naïve Bayes, SVM, boosting) and disparate features in various
ways using stacking improved recognition of rigorous studies. They
also found that manually assigned metadata like MeSH and publi-
cation types improved classiﬁcation effectiveness.

If an SR already is created in a given topic, a set of associated in-
cluded/excluded article judgments accumulates. These judgments
can serve as input to an ML algorithm for updating the SR. How-
ever, when an SR of another topic is ﬁrst created, no data for train-
ing the ML algorithm are available. To solve this problem, Cohen
and colleagues [6] proposed a method that creates a model by
training on the data from a combination of other SR topics that al-
ready has a base collection of included/excluded article judgments.
They compared this method with three systems, a baseline system
using only topic-speciﬁc training data obtaining from included/
excluded article judgments in associated SRs, a non-topic system
using only the non-topic data sampled from other SR topics, and
a hybrid system combining topic-speciﬁc training data with data
from other SR topics. On average, the hybrid system improved
the mean AUC over the baseline system by 20% when topic-speciﬁc
training data were scarce. In addition, the system performed better
than the non-topic system on all but the two smallest fractions of
topic-speciﬁc training data. However, with very sparse topic-
speciﬁc training data, the performance of the non-topic system
on individual topics is often better than the baseline system and
is, at times, better than that of the hybrid system.

3. Methods

We present our methods in three parts. In the ﬁrst, we describe
the data set used to evaluate our system. In the second, we show
the classiﬁer system. Finally, we describe our evaluation process.

3.1. Data collection

3.1.1. Procedure data sets

In this study, the procedure data corpus was collected, which
was based on SR inclusion/exclusion judgments of the expert
reviewers of the nHTA center. We analyzed criteria to judge inclu-
sion or exclusion articles of 126 SRs and classiﬁed common and to-
pic-speciﬁc ones. Common criteria are the same judgment criteria
across all SRs. The criteria are shown in Table 1. Common exclusion
criteria were as follows: gray literature (i.e., conference papers),
non-original articles (i.e., review articles, editorials, letters, and
opinion pieces), non-human (animal) articles, and pre-clinical
studies.

Among 126 SRs performed by the nHTA, we selected 19 proce-
dure SRs with more than 10 inclusion articles for this experiment.
Table 2 shows the 19 review topics with the number of articles in-
cluded and excluded in each study. The number of articles ex-
cluded by the common exclusion criteria (code 1-4) is shown in
parenthesis. The number before parenthesis means number of arti-
cles excluded by all exclusion criteria (code 1-5).

3.1.2. Drug data sets

We also used publicly available drug data to conﬁrm our meth-
od [15]. Table 3 gives information on the inclusion/exclusion crite-
ria of the drug topics [16]. We selected codes 8 and 9 as common
exclusion criteria across all drug SRs because we thought that
background articles (code 8) might be non-original articles (i.e., re-
view articles, editorials, letters, and opinion pieces) and that arti-
cles with only the abstracts available (code 9) might be gray
literature (i.e., conference papers). In the drug sets, the number
of common exclusion articles excluded by codes 8 and 9 were
small because most articles were excluded by code E. In this study,
we selected four topics (Atypical antipsychotics, Beta blockers, Cal-
cium channel blockers, Urinary incontinence) with more than 10
common exclusion articles. We also separated common exclusion
articles (code 8-9) from exclusion articles (code E-9) (Table 4).

3.1.3. Training and test sets

As shown in Fig. 1, our data sets consisted of a small number of
inclusion articles (I) and a large number of exclusion articles
(E = TE + CD). This class imbalance issue corresponds to domains
for which one class is represented by a large number of examples,
whereas the other is represented by only a few [17]. This problem
causes a signiﬁcant bottleneck in the performance attainable by
standard learning methods, which assume a balanced distribution
of the classes [18]. The classiﬁers, which are trained on the imbal-
anced data set, tend to have a bias toward the majority class data
because ML techniques cannot work well with such data for build-
ing an accurate classiﬁer [19].

a The number of common exclusion articles excluded by the common exclusion

criteria among excluded articles excluded by all the exclusion criteria.

In order to build the balanced training sets, we proceeded in
two phases. In the ﬁrst phase we randomly selected exclusion arti-
cles with the same number of inclusion articles regarding each to-
pic. Exclusion articles were sampled ﬁve times with replacement
for the future ﬁve times of the evaluation test. They were combined
with inclusion articles to form the balanced data set. In the second
phase, in order to make a training set we combined all of the non-
topic balanced data (Fig. 2). For example, regard to Auditory brain-
stem implant, we trained our model using the combined balanced
data set which consist of articles not related to the Auditory brain-
stem implant.

We made two kinds of the balanced training sets for each topic;
the ﬁrst set (IE training set) has inclusion articles (I) and exclusion
articles randomly selected from total exclusion articles (E), and the

Fig. 1. Article collection diagram. Our collection consists of inclusion articles (I),
topic-speciﬁc exclusion articles (TE), and common exclusion articles (CE). Each area
depicts the proportion of article types.

second set (ICE training set) consists of inclusion articles (I) and
common exclusion articles randomly selected from CE.

We used articles of each topic as test sets. Topics of each test set
are shown in Table 2 and 4. We also made two kinds of test sets for
each topic; one set (IE test set) has inclusion (I) and total exclusion
articles (E), and the other set (ICE test set) consists of inclusion (I)
and common exclusion articles (CE). For example, to classify Audi-
tory brainstem implant, the IE test set has 170 articles (14 inclusion
and 156 exclusion articles) and ICE test set has 60 articles (14
inclusion and 46 common exclusion articles).

3.2. Classiﬁer System

We used four basic feature types, listed as follows:

 Words in the titles of a MEDLINE citation.
 Words in the abstracts of a MEDLINE citation.
 Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) indexing terms from a MED-

LINE citation.

 Publication types assigned manually by NLM indexers.

The titles and abstracts were parsed into tokens. MeSH indexing
terms and publication types were encoded as phrases. Individual
words of the titles and abstracts were further processed by the

156

removal of stop words such as ‘the’, ‘an’, and ‘other’, which are not
likely to add semantic value to the classiﬁcation [20]. The words
were also stemmed by the Porter stemming algorithm [21].

As titles and abstracts are narrative texts, the frequency-based
representation is more appropriate. Conversely, because MeSH
indexing terms and publication types do not occur in an article
more than once, the binary representation method might be more
suitable for the feature types [4]. Therefore, we represented the ti-
tles and abstracts by word frequencies and the MeSH indexing
terms and publication types as binary.

In some tasks, it made sense to give some features weights
greater than those of other features [4]. However, we did not weigh
the features by term frequencies because, in an earlier study, the
authors
found that weighting features by intra-document
frequency and/or inverse document frequency (TF, IDF, TFIDF)
decreased the performance of the classiﬁer system [16].

The ML system presented here was motivated by interesting re-
sults observed in earlier studies on the best evidence for SRs [2,12–
14]. The authors found that using the SVM rather than other ML
techniques led to improved classiﬁcation performance. In the pres-
ent work, our basic ML system was the SVMlight [22] implementa-
tion of the SVM algorithm, with linear kernel and default settings
[23].

3.3. Evaluation

We evaluated how well our classiﬁers, which were trained on a
combination of inclusion and common exclusion articles, classiﬁed
rigorous articles for new procedure or drug SRs. We performed
three experiments.

 Experiment 1: IE training set + IE test set.

sets gave the ﬁnal performance estimate. We applied one-way
ANOVA to compare classiﬁer performances.

As an additional experiment, we performed 10-fold cross vali-
dation tests. The goal of cross validation is measuring the general-
izability of an algorithm, comparing the performance of two or
more different algorithms, and ﬁnding out the best algorithm for
the available data [24]. In 10-fold cross validation, we used IE
and ICE data sets. A single subsample is used as the validation data
for testing the model, and the remaining nine subsamples are used
as training data. We applied independent t-test to compare the re-
sults of IE and ICE data sets.

4. Results

In order to evaluate the performance of the classiﬁers, we made
receiver operating curves. The area under the curve (AUC) was cal-
culated for the Procedure with inclusion and exclusion/common
exclusion articles. The same evaluation was done using AUCs for
the Drug with inclusion and exclusion/common exclusion articles.
Table 5 shows the performances using 19 Procedure data by
topics. The mean AUC of the Experiment 1 was 0.81 (range 0.66–
0.91), Experiment 2 was 0.83 (range 0.70–0.90), and Experiment
3 was 0.95 (range 0.89–1.00). The performances of the classiﬁers
trained on the Procedure with inclusion and common exclusion
articles (Experiments 2, 3) were signiﬁcantly higher than those of
the classiﬁers trained on the Procedure with inclusion and exclu-
sion articles (Experiment 1) (p < 0.05). The classiﬁer showed the

Table 6 indicates that the performances using 4 Drug data by

0.71–0.83), Experiment 2 was 0.73 (range 0.56–0.87), and Experi-
ment 3 was 0.84 (range 0.77–0.90). The performances of the clas-
siﬁers trained on the Drug with inclusion and common exclusion
articles (Experiment 3) were signiﬁcantly higher than those of
the classiﬁers trained on the Drug with inclusion and exclusion
articles (Experiments 1, 2) only if test data consisted of inclusion
and common exclusion articles (p < 0.05).

The 10-fold cross validation results showed that the mean AUC
of IC data was 0.93 with a standard deviation of 0.02 and ICE data
was 0.97 with a standard deviation of 0.01 in Procedure data sets.
In Drug data sets, the mean AUC of IC data was 0.84 with a stan-
dard deviation of 0.03 and that of ICE data was 0.92 with a stan-
dard deviation of 0.05. In both of Procedure and Drug SRs, the
results of ICE data which used common exclusion articles were sig-
niﬁcantly better than those of IC data (p < 0.05).

5. Discussion

Our results show that AUCs of the classiﬁers trained on the Pro-
cedure with common exclusion articles were signiﬁcantly higher
than those of the classiﬁers trained on the Procedure with exclu-
sion articles. In Drug, the AUCs of the classiﬁers trained with com-
mon exclusion articles were signiﬁcantly higher than those of the
classiﬁers trained with exclusion articles when test data consisted
of inclusion and common exclusion articles.

When we performed the cross validation experiments, the AUCs
of the classiﬁers showed slightly better results than the previous
experiments. For instance the mean AUC of the Experiment 1
was improved from 0.81 to 0.93 in the case of Procedure data
set. The reason for the good performance in cross validation test
might be understood that in cross validation experiment, some
topics in test data were included into the training data sets. As
the SVM classiﬁer was already trained with a speciﬁc topic, so it
would classify better. However, in the real world, above situation
happens rarely. There will be many topics that are not systemati-
cally reviewed, in which our method can be helpful.

We focused on reducing the labor required for capturing high-
quality articles to the new SRs that are not systematically re-
viewed. If experts performing SRs use our classiﬁers after manually
ﬁltering out topic-speciﬁc exclusion articles, their workload of lit-
erature review will be reduced. Further research is required an ex-
tended learning system that classiﬁes topic-speciﬁc exclusion
articles of the new SRs.

Our evaluation has several limitations. The sample sizes were
small. Although the data corpus included 19 topics and expert
judgments, there were approximately 7200 articles overall. We
used the data generated by an SR-producing organization, which
is a limitation even if the nHTA uses the most rigorous processes
to maximize quality and consistency. We tried to conﬁrm our
method using drug SRs generated by DERP (Drug Evidence Review

those articles because, in drug SRs, most articles were classiﬁed
as E (nonspeciﬁcally excluded).

6. Conclusion

Our research has provided that SVM-based high-quality article
classiﬁers can support new SRs by reducing the labor required to
experts reviewing journal articles for inclusion. We focused on
data in training sets to improve the performance of classiﬁers
and showed the method of constructing training sets. The perfor-
mance of classiﬁers, which were trained on a combination of inclu-
sion and common exclusion articles, were signiﬁcantly higher than
those of the classiﬁers, which were trained on other data.
