        <p>Strategic management is a key discipline that permits companies to achieve their competitive goals. An effective and explicit alignment and integration of business strategy with SPI initiatives based on measurement is essential to prevent loss of income, customers and competitiveness. By integrating SPI models and measurement techniques in the strategy management process, an organization's investments will be better aligned with strategy, optimizing the benefits obtained as a result of an SPI program. In this paper, the authors propose BOQM (Balanced Objective-Quantifiers Methodology) that integrates properly strategic management, process improvement and quantitative measurement to manage the competitiveness of software engineering organizations. Finally, this paper presents and discusses the results from implementing BOQM in a software development organization.</p>

      <title>1 Introduction</title>
      <p>
        At present, competitiveness is a key factor to assure the survival of companies in the
market
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">(Mehra and Inman 2004)</xref>
        . Information and communication technologies (ICT) are
essential elements that contribute to improving a company’s competitiveness
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21 ref28">(Kamel et al.
2009; Kuppusamy et al. 2008)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        Nowadays, it is widely known that strategic management is a key discipline that permits
companies to achieve their competitive goals
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">(Fahey 2007)</xref>
        . However, in 63% of
organizations, the role of ICT is essential to achieve their business goals, but often, it is limited to
the operational level, having little consideration and influence in the definition of an
organization’s strategy
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">(Asgarkhani 2006)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        Nevertheless, effective management and improvement of internal processes in software
development, operation and maintenance organizations [hereafter software engineering
organization (SEO)] have contributed to improving the competitiveness of this type of
organization in the ICT market
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">(Asgarkhani 2006)</xref>
        . Many case studies
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32 ref38 ref9">(Mcloone and
Rohde 2007; Qi 2007; El-Emam 2007)</xref>
        demonstrate that software development companies
have achieved success by adopting SPI models such as capability maturity model
integration (CMMI). Moreover, professionals and managers are agreed on their effectiveness
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">(Oliveira et al. 2009)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        So, aligning SPI initiatives and efforts with strategic management principles and
techniques is essential to manage and control costs and quality of an SEO
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19 ref27">(Kojima et al.
2007; Issac et al. 2006)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        However, it is important to highlight that, in the software industry, there are few
relevant case studies with enough detail
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">(Goethert and Siviy 2004)</xref>
        where SPI initiatives
are directed or well aligned with the company’s strategy, quantitatively controlled by a
measurement program and the information needs of senior management are integrated
appropriately.
      </p>
      <p>The problem addressed in this paper is the effective and explicit integration of strategic
management, process improvement and quantitative measurement to manage efficiently
the competitiveness of SEOs.</p>
      <sec id="sec-1-1">
        <title>The hypothesis of this research work is: ‘‘If there is a methodology available, especially</title>
        <p>focused on SEOs, that integrates strategic management activities, process improvement
principles and measurement techniques, it will be possible to manage an SEO strategy,
potentially increasing the synergies among all stakeholders and distributing the knowledge
at all levels for effective decision-making.’’</p>
        <p>Consequently, the authors decided on the following research activities:
1.</p>
        <p>Analyze different approaches that enable the integration of strategy management,
process improvement and measurement techniques in SEOs (Sect. 2).</p>
        <p>Define a methodology that allows SPI models to integrate and manage SEO strategy,
based on measurement (Sect. 3).</p>
        <p>Apply in a real organization the methodology defined in order to determine whether it
contributes to increasing the synergies among stakeholders and provides key
information for decision-making at all levels in the company (Sect. 4).</p>

      <title>2 Literature review</title>
      <p>
        As Lamb et al. state, strategic management is ‘‘an ongoing process that evaluates and
controls the business and the industries in which the company is involved; and then
reassesses each strategy regularly to determine how it has been implemented and whether
it has succeeded’’
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">(Lamb 2008)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        Strategic management is a combination of three main processes: strategy formulation,
strategy implementation and strategy evaluation, which then cycles back to strategy
formulation
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">(Kaplan and Norton 2005)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <sec id="sec-2-1">
        <title>Before formulating the strategy in SEOs, it is necessary to add another sub-process in</title>
        <p>strategic management, called environmental scanning. SEOs need to be proactive
compared to other competitive organizations and to identify all external and internal
vulnerabilities.</p>
        <p>Next, the current proposals to implement strategy management in SEOs are presented
using the four-phase scheme as an analysis framework (see Fig. 1).</p>
        <sec id="sec-2-1-1">
          <title>2.1 Environmental scanning</title>
          <p>
            The purpose of this strategy management sub-process is to analyze the current situation of
an SEO in the environment in which it operates. Trienekens
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">(Trienekens et al. 2009)</xref>
            stresses that a software organization should not only be aware of its own internal
conditions, but also its external conditions. A SWOT
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">(strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and
threats; Kahraman et al. 2007)</xref>
            analysis is the most common tool to evaluate the current
state of an SEO in relation to its strategy. A SWOT analysis can be complemented with
other specific techniques to analyze the organization’s internal and external context.
          </p>
          <p>
            The analysis of the external context is centerd on a competitor’s evaluation using
several techniques. The most representative are: (a) Market research
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">(Belk 2007)</xref>
            ; (b)
business intelligence
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">(Watson and Wixom 2007)</xref>
            ; (c) five forces
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37 ref6">(Porter 1979; Chastek
et al. 2009)</xref>
            ; and (d) PEST analysis
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">(Peng and Nunes 2007)</xref>
            .
          </p>
          <p>
            The analysis of the internal context consists of assessing the elements of an organization
that influence the strategy such as processes, human resources and the current state of its
information systems. In SEOs, there are many approaches to identify the strengths and
weaknesses of processes. The most relevant are SCAMPI (standard CMMI appraisal
method for process improvement; SEI 2006) and the ISO/IEC 15504 standard
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">(ISO 2004)</xref>
            .
There are also other quality models that have been successfully applied in SEOs, such as
ISO 9000
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">(ISO 2008)</xref>
            , COBIT
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">(Watson and Wixom 2007)</xref>
            and ITIL
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">(Long 2008)</xref>

          <title>2.2 Strategy formulation</title>
          <p>
            The purpose of this sub-process is to define the strategy in terms of quantitative objectives,
without forgetting the organization’s vision and constraints. The strategic objectives
formulation requires effective techniques to manage the strategy as a whole. Executives
use strategic maps
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">(Kaplan and Norton 2008)</xref>
            to address business strategies effectively.
The balanced scorecard
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">(BSC; Kaplan and Norton 2006)</xref>
            clearly specifies how to formulate
the strategy map using four quadrants: customers, internal processes, innovation and
growth, and financial perspectives.
          </p>
          <p>One of the difficulties in formulating the strategy quantitatively is to link the strategic or
business objectives with the product and process measurements and the expected values for
improvement based on an appropriate analysis of the current situation. There are two kinds
of proposals to solve this problem:

          <p>This process defines the operational models that implement the actions required to achieve
the business and process improvement objectives. The activities in this phase are related to
the definition, pilot implementation and improvement of the organization’s internal
processes.</p>

        <sec id="sec-2-3-2">
          <title>2.4 Analysis and control of the strategy implementation</title>
          <p>
            In this process, an SEO has to obtain objective data and analyze them to determine the
extent to which the strategic objectives have been accomplished. There are two key
activities in this process: (a) data collection, whose main goal is to ensure that data
gathered is defined and accurate. An ISO standard
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">(ISO 2007)</xref>
            is used, but other proposals
(PSM, ABCM and BSC&amp;GQM) provide their own approach; (b) data information is an
activity for providing decision makers with useful periodic reports on the state of the
software processes and products. ABCM, PSM &amp; BSC, KBS and BSC&amp;GQM use the
balanced scorecard as an information system to get the big picture of the current state of
the strategy.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a result of this state-of-the-art analysis, it can be said that the strategy of SEOs is
often related to short- and medium-term plans and limited to their domain. Consequently,
an SEO attempts to do its part in meeting the overall business strategy, but it is difficult to
know how the SEO’s performance contributes to implementing the business strategy
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34 ref4">(Mishra and Mishra 2008; Capell 2004)</xref>
            . In order to align efficiently SPI goals and
activities with business objectives, it is necessary to integrate properly and explicitly the
SPI management activities with strategic management activities.
          </p>
          <p>
            By analyzing the measurement proposals previously presented, it can be stated that
there are non-integrated proposals that partially solve some specific problems of aligning
the definition and control of SPI objectives with business strategy management.
Nevertheless, the alignment and integration of business strategy with SPI initiatives in an SEO
often fail for several reasons
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14 ref15 ref7">(Harjumaa et al. 2008; Gopal et al. 2005; Dyba˚ 2005)</xref>
            :
•
•
•
•
          </p>
          <p>Lack of coordination and alignment among all the roles and responsibilities involved in
both business and SEO strategies.</p>
          <p>Lack of senior management commitment to implementing the SEO strategy due to
insufficient information on how SEO strategic objectives contribute to their business
strategy.</p>
          <p>Lack of employee commitment through failure of management to communicate the
business and SEO strategies to their employees and lack of incentives given to workers
to embrace the new strategy.</p>
          <p>
            Poor communication resulting from insufficient information sharing among
stakeholders or exclusion of stakeholders in the knowledge-sharing processes

2001)</xref>
            .
          </p>
          <p>To solve the problems of achieving the synergies required to align business objectives
and SEO goals, it is necessary to refine already existing proposals, defining an approach
that:
•
•
•
•</p>
          <p>Seamlessly integrates strategic management, process improvement and measurement to
control efficiently the current status of SPI initiatives.</p>

the required synergies for effective competitive management.</p>
          <p>Contributes to capturing and disseminating useful knowledge of SPI initiatives and
results to control the business strategy at all levels of the organization.</p>

improvement objectives with business strategy objectives.</p>

    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-3">
      <title>3 A balanced objective-quantifiers methodology</title>
      <p>The balanced objective-quantifiers method (BOQM) is a process guided by the SEO’s key
roles to design, implement and control a quantitative strategy through indicators aligned
with strategic and improvement objectives in a BSC.</p>
      <p>Balanced objective-quantifiers method includes the four perspectives of the BSC
(financial, internal, customer and innovation and growth) and presents a clear state of the
organization and its strategic advance. BOQM also applies the GQM principles to provide
well-informed measures and justify indicators through goals-questions-measures. Finally,
BOQM is also based on the main PSM principles to derive indicators and identify cause–
effect relations between them.</p>
      <p>BOQM is based on the process orientation philosophy. Figure 2 summarizes the BOQM
process. The numbers in fig. 2 correspond to the activities described in this section. The
complete process will be available after defense of Mitre’s dissertation (in mid-2010) at
http://sel.inf.uc3m.es/hmitre/BOQM.html.</p>
      <p>The internal context is defined by (1) the technological infrastructure, (2) the SPI model
or SPI initiatives introduced and (3) the stakeholders. The technological infrastructure,
relates to technological resources such as PCs, laptops, servers and networks. The
previous SPI initiatives specify the scope and intensity of previous activities in this area
and the software model used as a basis for these (CMMI, TSP, PSP, ISO 12207, etc.).
The external context, obtained from surveys, is defined by (1) social behavior, (2) the
local industry and market, including industry competitors, potential entrants, buyers,
substitutes and suppliers. Social behavior is the social levels present in the sector and
the ease of access to information technologies. The local industry represents other
organizations in the same sector or company-related activity; and the local market is
the type of suppliers, purchasers and final clients. A PEST or SWOT analysis can be
considered support techniques.</p>
      <sec id="sec-3-1">
        <title>3.2 Definition sub-process</title>
        <p>The purpose of this sub-process is to define the strategy in terms of quantitative objectives
bearing in mind the organization’s vision.</p>
        <p>2. Identify and clarify vision and mission. The vision statement describes the
organization’s aims and what specific motivation binds the stakeholders, including members,
leaders and anyone else involved. The vision reflects the realization of the organization’s
values.</p>
        <p>3. Formulate strategic objectives that are based on the internal and external context,
bearing in mind the vision and mission definitions.</p>
        <sec id="sec-3-1-1">
          <title>4. Define an operational model for each strategic objective. The operational model</title>
          <p>represents the set of actions needed to operate a strategic objective. It is composed of
specific actions to implement the strategic and/or improvement objectives. From this
activity, the first version of the BOQM analysis model is obtained. Figure 3 presents the
structure and a snapshot of a part of the analysis model defined for BOQM; the complete
model can be seen at http://sel.inf.uc3m.es/hmitre/AnalysisModel.html. When applying
BOQM, this analysis model has to be customized for a specific organization through the
following activities.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec-3-1-2">
          <title>5. Derive one or more quantitative improvement objectives (IOs) from the strategic</title>
          <p>objectives and their operational model.</p>
          <p>To derive IOs, the strategic objective is divided into measurable pieces, taking into
account that these IOs can support decision-making during the operational model
implementation. The following information categories can be covered in BOQM: (1)
Software products quality: to improve the product quality, or product functionality and
stability; (2) software process performance: to analyze and tailor the plan to improve
an SEO’s process capabilities; (3) organization capacity: to direct the performance and
structure of the organization’s staff toward the desired goals; (4) technology
performance: to evaluate the effectiveness of the technology; (5) resources and costs:
to estimate and control the cost of resources and activities; (6) customer satisfaction: to
improve customer satisfaction, or to control customer support; and (7) project
schedule: to improve project management capabilities to meet the organizational
commitments in terms of delivery agenda.
b. Identify, if necessary, process area or life cycle phase that affects IOs. This step is
addressed by the SPI model selected or the SPI initiative. The process area or life cycle
phase can facilitate the source of data required for measurements and data collection
for the indicators.
c. Assign priorities to IOs.</p>
          <p>6. Develop indicators and measurement procedures. The inputs for this activity are the
BOQM analysis model (see Fig. 3) and the resulting catalog of IOs. The output products
are the set of measurement constructors. Tasks included in this activity are:
a. As the IOs are measurable pieces obtained from the strategic objectives, this task
consists of cataloging the IOs in the information categories (IC) considered in the
BOQM analysis model.
b. Identify the measurement concepts (MC) from the information categories. We suggest
reading the questions for each measurable concept that can satisfy the IO (see Fig. 3)
and selecting the appropriate question and measurement concept. Each question
belongs to a BSC quadrant. Therefore, the measurement analyst does not worry about
categorizing the questions and improvement objectives into the BSC perspectives.

          <p>7. Identify cause–effect relationship between indicators and prioritize improvement
objectives. Here, the BOQM analysis model and a catalog of IO aligned with constructors
are needed. Each IO is aligned with an MC, and the MCs have cause–effect relationships.
The measurement analyst identifies the relationships from the BOQM analysis model, and
the SEO manager takes the decision to prioritize the IOs.</p>

      <title>4 BOQM application and results obtained</title>
      <p>Having defined BOQM, the authors applied it to determine whether it contributes to: (a)
managing effectively SEO competitiveness, enabling the alignment of SEO strategic
objectives, SPI initiatives and measurement constructs used to monitor the organization’s
performance; (b) increasing the synergies among all the stakeholders involved in the
business strategy management, the SEO performance control and the management of SPI
initiatives; and (c) capturing and disseminating useful knowledge of SPI initiatives and
results to control business strategy at all levels of the organization.</p>
      <p>Results obtained using BOQM were compared with previous initiatives of the same type
in the same organization. Information sources for this discussion are:

          <title>4.1.1 Background</title>
          <p>BOQM was implemented in a medium-sized SEO of a company called AGROSEGURO.
The information presented in this section was obtained during the execution of BOQM
Activity 1. The company is one of the main insurance corporations in Spain whose clients
are farmers, livestock breeders and other insurance companies. It has about 200 employees;
around 35 were in the development department (Sept 2008). Staff turnover is very low and
the composition of working groups is very stable, with few changes each year. The type of
software developed by the SEO is information management systems in host environments
(AS/400) with web interfaces developed using Java technologies. There is also a small
team for the development and maintenance of windows-based applications to support
mobile users without a stable internet connection. There were previous initiatives in this
SEO to improve performance and efficiency:
•</p>
          <p>The first software process improvement initiative was to introduce several process areas
included in CMMI level 2 (staged version).
The second software process improvement initiative was to obtain an ISO 9000-3:2000
certification for development processes.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec-4-2-2">
          <title>4.1.2 Process improvement goals and activities</title>
          <p>In order to align AGROSEGURO’s SEO performance with the business objectives, a new
software process improvement initiative was launched. BOQM was used to control the
alignment of these three elements: business goals, SEO goals and the SPI initiatives.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec-4-2-3">
          <title>4.1.3 Mission and vision</title>
          <p>As result of BOQM activity 2, AGROSEGURO SEO’s mission was stated. It is to provide
good quality and optimize the delivery term for each assignment to the rest of organization
areas at AGROSEGURO. The vision of the SEO is to be capable of planning new product
portfolios at the beginning of the year, and to achieve the objectives by the end of the year.
This means that the development teams would not be burdened with continuous corrective
maintenance tasks and support that prevent the annual objectives from being met.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec-4-2-4">
          <title>4.1.4 Strategic and SPI objectives</title>
          <p>According to the SEO’s mission and vision, the strategic objectives (SOs) to be managed
using BOQM were defined during the execution of BOQM Activity 3. Moreover, an
operational model (OM) was defined for each strategic objective considered as a result of
BOQM Activity 4. Finally, the definition of the improvement objectives (IO) was the result
of BOQM Activity 5.
4.1.4.1 Strategic objective 1 (S.O.1) Align the organization of the development
department with the demands of other units in the enterprise. This strategic objective had to be
achieved in 1 year. In order to do so, a set of activities for the organizational reconstruction
in the development department was initiated. The specific improvement objective
identified for this strategic objective was to reorganize the structure of the teams in the
development department (IO1.1).
4.1.4.2 Strategic objective 2 (S.O.2) Optimize the work that can be done by the
development department, increasing the capability to manage efficiently the available resources.
This strategic objective (SO) had to be achieved in 1 year. The activities to achieve this
objective were those required to define and deploy a new process for project control and
tracking and the specific improvement objectives identified for this strategic objective were:
IO2.1: separate development and support, optimizing the workflow; IO2.2: center and
reallocate roles and performance; and IO2.3: strengthen the management control system.
4.1.4.3 Strategic objective 3 (S.O.3) Increase the quality of the work delivered to other
units at AGROSEGURO. This strategic objective had to be achieved in 1 year. The
activities were those required to optimize the development processes and improve the
training of the personnel who use them. The specific improvement objectives identified for
this strategic objective were: IO3.1: improve the development software processes
displayed and IO3.2: improve personnel capabilities and performance in the development
department.</p>
          <p>Once the improvement objectives were identified, the SPI initiatives were initiated.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec-4-2-5">
          <title>4.1.5 Measurement constructs identified and results obtained</title>
          <p>BOQM activity 6 was carried out to identify measurement constructs (indicators) to control
strategic and improvement objectives.</p>
          <p>First, the questions to control the achievement of these objectives were selected and
correctly linked to the corresponding strategic objectives (Fig. 4).</p>
          <p>Having defined these questions, the activities for defining the measurement constructs
were then carried out. The measurement constructs selected and the target values are
presented in Fig. 4.</p>
          <p>Once measurement constructs were defined, several cause–effect relations among them
were identified (BOQM Activity 7). ‘‘i1.2.1, Number of days to do the work by type of
work’’ affects ‘‘i3.2.1 Average added value of the services provided to users’’ is an
example of the types of relationships identified. Any problem with schedule overruns has a
negative impact on the benefits that the customer obtains from using the solution provided.</p>
          <p>Once the BOQM analysis model was adapted to AGROSEGURO, the software process
improvement activities were done in parallel with the activities for gathering the required
data to compile the measurement constructs considered (BOQM Activities 8 and 9). The
evolution of measurement construct values was periodically analyzed (BOQM Activity
10). The conclusions of these analyses were also communicated to AGROSEGURO’s SEO
staff within the same periods (BOQM Activity 11).</p>
          <p>The values achieved at the end of the SPI activities for each measurement construct are
presented in Fig. 4 (marked as actual values). In several cases, the organization did not
achieve the expected values, but the SEO managers considered that the expected values
would be achieved shortly.</p>
          <p>Finally, several lessons learned were identified during the evaluation of the participants’
satisfaction and the BOQM process performance (BOQM Activity 12). Several of these
lessons are discussed in Sect. 4.2.</p>
        </sec>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-4-3">
        <title>4.2 Lessons learned from the BOQM application</title>
        <p>This section presents the observations gathered during the BOQM application at
AGROSEGURO. The discussion is divided in three areas: (a) alignment of an SEO’s strategic
objectives, SPI initiatives and measurement constructs; (b) synergies among stakeholders
involved in the BOQM initiative; and (c) effective knowledge sharing on strategy
implementation across all organizational levels.</p>
        <p>It is important to note that previous SPI initiatives had a lack of alignment among
business goals, SEO goals and the SPI initiatives, although the support of senior
management was obtained. This support was implemented by providing the
resources required for SPI initiatives and a few senior managers participated in
monitoring the process of defining the SPI and measurement initiatives
It is important to state that the active participation of AGROSEGURO’s SEO
manager in BOQM and the use of the information provided by senior managers
helped to achieve a full alignment between the formulation of business and the</p>
        <p>SEO’s objectives
In consequence, the BOQM practitioners indicated in final interviews that
leadership involvement is not synonymous with success in aligning business
and SEO strategies. The BOQM practitioners concluded that senior
management participation should not only consist of providing resources and
political support, but also it is essential that senior managers provide relevant
information on their insights and points of view. The BOQM process
orientation facilitated effective senior management participation</p>
        <p>In previous initiatives, an important lack of alignment was detected because the
business view was centerd on having a greater amount of products delivered,
and the SEO’s view on managing more rationally the projects portfolio and
delivering products of higher quality. In addition, although senior and SEO
managers agreed on the set of measures in the past, the reports submitted to
management were very complex, without providing meaningful information on
the number and the quality of products delivered
At the end of the BOQM application, the participants indicated that the definition
of strategic and improvement objectives were more related to the actual
situation at AGROSEGURO’s SEO and they were more feasible. This better
alignment was obtained because the BOQM process and analysis model
enhanced common understanding of business goals among stakeholders, how
the SEO could contribute to achieving them and how the organizational
problems of the SEO could be solved
As the information model obtained for managing the strategy was more aligned,
indicators and the cause–effect relationships among them helped to identify the
impact of the changes in the values of several measurement constructs on the
values of other measurement constructs. So, it was simpler to evaluate the
impact of internal changes on the degree of accomplishment of the business and
the SEO’s objectives
Finally, the indicators’ aggregation levels provided by the BOQM analysis model
contributed to providing the appropriate information to the different
stakeholders (senior manager, SEO managers and software engineers).</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, it is important to mention that measurement is meaningless
without interpretation and judgment by those who make decisions and take
actions based on indicators</p>
        <sec id="sec-4-3-1">
          <title>4.2.1 Alignment of an SEO’s strategic objectives, SPI initiatives and measurement constructs</title>
          <p>The improved alignment of an SEO’s strategy with business objectives due to BOQM can
be analyzed in two ways: alignment during strategic objectives definition and alignment of
the elements configuring the strategic plan (Tables 1, 2).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec-4-3-2">
          <title>4.2.2 Synergies among stakeholders involved in the BOQM initiative</title>
          <p>Integration of strategic management, process improvement and quantitative measurement
requires combining properly the knowledge, experience and competencies of stakeholders
involved in this process. The main BOQM contribution is in the enhancement of synergies
among stakeholders (Table 3).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec-4-3-3">
          <title>4.2.3 BOQM’s contribution to capturing and spreading useful knowledge</title>
          <p>The practical application of BOQM indicated that the capture and spread of relevant
knowledge on the current state of actions and implementing the business strategy, are
essential to maintaining the alignment between business goals and SPI initiatives. BOQM’s
contribution to capturing and spreading useful knowledge can be discussed from three
Enhancement of synergies between stakeholders involved in the definition of the business strategy, SPI and
measurement initiatives</p>
          <p>During previous SPI initiatives, it was mentioned that the lack of alignment
among the business and the SEO goals, SPI initiatives and the related
measurement programs was partially due to a lack of a clear process indicating
the specific information to be defined and the roles and responsibilities of those
involved. This lack of predefined process created several problems related to
the type of relevant information to be obtained. Moreover, there were frequent
and serious discrepancies during teamwork sessions because of conflicting
points of view. Finally, the lower level employees were reluctant to participate
freely and actively in teamwork sessions due to the participation of senior and</p>
          <p>SEO managers
The application of BOQM provided several benefits:
First, the BOQM training was more focused, providing specific training for all
participants and more detailed insight into the concepts and activities assigned
to each role participating in the process. Moreover, the examples taken from
already existing case studies and adapted to BOQM were evaluated positively
because they clarified how to complete the BOQM process
Second, the use of a formalized process enhanced the visibility of the current state
of the process. The stakeholders involved were able to identify what activities
remained and what internal products were needed before the process was
completed
Third, roles and responsibilities were identified and clearly defined at the
beginning, so each worker involved knew what was expected of him to define
the SEO’s objectives and indicators. Participants also considered that the
responsibilities assigned to each of them matched their skills and experience
Fourth, the way the activities were organized among stakeholders enhanced the
combination of expertise in an organized way, preventing bottlenecks in long
non-productive discussions and enabling active participation of workers at the
lower levels. Finally, participants remarked that the BOQM process orientation
reduced back-office work, and promoted more structured interaction among
stakeholders
Effective use of pre-existing knowledge</p>
          <p>During the first two initiatives where there was no use of pre-existing knowledge
because the objectives were selected and indicators identified from scratch. In
consequence, participants spent more effort than expected in re-work because
senior management’s orientation and guidelines were not considered
appropriately
The observations gathered during the application of BOQM and the interviews
conducted at the end of the project indicate that using this predefined
knowledge organized in BSC perspectives has had several positive effects.</p>
          <p>Specifically, the use of predefined schemes of business objectives, SPI goals
and measurement constructs reduced the number of arguments on the
appropriateness of the improvement objectives and indicators. Moreover, the
application of the BSC perspectives helped to organize the information in the
same way senior management organize knowledge on business objectives,
enhancing meaningful interchange of knowledge between organizational levels
points of view: (a) Effective use of pre-existing knowledge; (b) effective gathering of
required data; and (c) knowledge sharing on the current state of the organization (Tables 4,
5, 6).</p>
          <p>The information provided by the SEO staff was low quality because they did not
really know why the data were necessary and what the actual use of the
information was for. Due to this lack of information, the SEO staff were
concerned about the use of the data
After the application of BOQM, the quality of the information improved. The
participation of workers at all professional levels in defining the SEO’s
objectives and indicators for their control contributed to increasing confidence
in using information
Knowledge sharing on the current state of the organization</p>
          <p>Indicators and the related reports were used to provide senior management with
data for decision-making and to assess the effects of the improvement actions in
the SEO organization
During the BOQM application, several types of reports were prepared. Senior
managers and software engineers evaluated very positively the overall picture
provided by the four BSC perspectives
Although it was positively evaluated at AGROSEGURO, the BOQM philosophy
includes not only these traditional uses, but also availability and data feedback,
and the use of data to guide SPI actions. This feedback on actual performance
not only motivated a change in the behavior of individuals, groups and the
organization as a whole, but also guided change in a specific direction
The BOQM information model contributed to enabling learning across all
organizational levels, instead of enabling exclusively decision-making activities
for senior and SEO management purposes</p>

      <title>5 Conclusions</title>
      <p>In this paper, BOQM was defined to link strategic objectives and IOs with measures in a
BSC, using the GQM approach and the integrated analysis model of Practical Software
Measurement (PSM). The BSC, GQM and PSM are integrated in such a way that strategy
formulation and control are simpler and more traceable.</p>
      <p>BOQM was applied in an SEO and compared with previous measurement initiatives in
the same organization. This pilot application provides a relevant example, indicating that
BOQM can contribute to satisfying the research hypothesis stated in the introduction. The
specific findings identified as conclusions of the BOQM pilot application are:
•
•
•</p>
      <p>BOQM offers traceability among strategic objectives, operative models, improvement
objectives, questions and indicators.</p>
      <p>BOQM provides a process defining the roles, responsibilities and competencies of the
stakeholders involved and creating the required synergies for effective competitive
management.</p>
      <p>BOQM provides an effective framework to capture and spread useful knowledge of SPI
initiatives and their results to control business strategy at all levels of the organization.</p>
      <p>The BOQM analysis model allows one to see the big picture of the knowledge
generated in the formulation activities, analysis and control of the strategy process
defined.</p>
      <p>Finally, the BOQM measurement context is not only limited to product and process
measurement, but also measures staff performance, effectiveness of the technology, costs
and customer satisfaction.</p>
      <p>The next steps of this research work are focused on an empirical evaluation of BOQM
compared to other software measurement approaches such as BSC, GQM and PSM.
Moreover, BOQM is being implemented in other organizations, so the BOQM analysis
model will be enriched. In addition, a software assistant is being developed to guide
BOQM practitioners to follow the process in the most effective way.</p>
