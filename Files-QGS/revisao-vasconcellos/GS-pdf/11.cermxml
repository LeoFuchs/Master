        <p>The Rosetta Stone Methodology (RSM) has been developed which allows organizations to undertake Software Process Improvement (SPI) based on business- and organizational-driven goals and objectives. The methodology itself is fully customizable and allows organizations to make adjustments to the model where they feel it appropriate. To demonstrate the usefulness, appropriateness and practicality of this new approach, the Rosetta Stone IGSIISM to CMMI Instance mapping (RS-ICMMI) is developed. To aid in understanding, the Measurement and Analysis (MA) process area is used as an example of how to apply the methodology. The Rosetta Stone Methodology and the RS-ICMMI instance have been validated by experts.</p>

        •
According to the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
        ],
total worldwide spending on ICT was expected to reach $2.964 trillion in 2005, the
last year for which the OECD has published estimates. Given the massive amount of
spending involved, anything which can shave even a few percentage points off costs
could potentially free up a large amount of capital that could be re-invested in the
organization. From a Software Process Improvement perspective, there are several
competing and, in some cases, complementary standards such as the Software
Engineering Institute’s CMMI for Development version 1.2 [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
        ], the International
Standards Organization’s (ISO) 15504 [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>
        ], and the International Standards
Organisation’s ISO 9000-3 [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>
        ] and ISO 9001:2000 [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>
        ] standards, a process-driven
approach to define, establish and maintain software quality within an organization
that will allow organizations to meet their business objectives [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>
        Productivity: There are many studies which demonstrate that productivity
increases as a result of software process improvement. These include Brodman
and Johnson [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>
        ], Dion [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>
        ], and Herbsleb et al. [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>
        ].
Quality: Studies analysed demonstrate that as organizations implement more
quality-oriented processes, the quality of code improves. Additionally, quality
increases as process capability maturity levels increase. Studies in this area
include Krasner, Pyles et al. [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>
        ] and Putnam and Myers [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>
        ]. We also note that
it becomes more difficult, and therefore more costly, to increase quality between
higher maturity levels.
      </p>
      <p>
        Financial Benefit: Evidence of the financial benefit resulting from the
implementation of SPI may be expressed as a ratio of cost to benefit (or vice
versa) or as a discussion of costs and benefits separately, and published research
tends to centre on ratios rather than on costs and benefits. Example studies
include the SEI [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>
        ] and Sapp, Stoddard et al. [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>All these initiatives have demonstrated improvement in an organization’s systems
capabilities but these improvements were approached from an IT perspective. There is
no ability within the established methodologies to define what benefits/objectives an
organization would like to achieve and use business-centric objectives to drive what
particular SPI initiatives should be undertaken. We also note that IT organizations
have tended to drive the SPI agenda in order to achieve IT benefits as a primary
objective, and organizational benefits as a secondary objective. However, this is
typically not the way the commercial world works – in the commercial world it is the
business which drives IT, not the other way around. The Rosetta Stone Methodology
(RSM), which we developed and validated during this research, allows businesses to
undertake business- and organizational-driven goals and objectives using SPI. In
addition, we present a specific instance of the RSM, the RS-ICMMI (Rosetta Stone
Implementation for CMMI) mapping, presenting details on the Measurement and
Analysis (MA) process area.</p>
      <p>
        Section 2 of this paper describes the Research Methods used in developing both the
meta-model and the operationalisation of the methodology. Section 3 describes the
Rosetta Stone meta-model. This meta-model provides an abstract representation of the
relationships between business objectives, software process improvement process
areas, and the indicators/metrics which may be used to demonstrate progress or
regression of the implementation of SPI within an organization. Section 4 describes
the methodology used to arrive at a concrete implementation of the meta-model. In
section 5 we create an instance of a mapping. The implementation presented here is a
mapping from the IGSI-ISM benefits model, a generic benefits model developed by
IBM India [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>
        ], to the CMMI (Staged) SPI model and will hereafter be referred to as
the Rosetta Stone IGSI-ISM to CMMI implementation or RS-ICMMI for short. We
discuss the validation of this model through interviews with experts. Section 6
concludes the paper.

      <title>Research Methods</title>
      <p>Once we had established through literature review and expert interviews that there
was no readily usable approach which supported businesses in deciding which
software processes to improve to gain specific business benefits, we commenced the
development of an objectives-driven approach whose use should allow this. The first
step was to create a generic methodology, the Rosetta Stone Methodology (RSM).
This was done by creating a meta-model of all the elements involved in an SPI
implementation. After this, a step-by-step approach was developed which guides
practitioners in using an SPI methodology combined with a benefits model. We
defined a mapping between business-focused benefits and individual SPI process
areas. In essence, this process allows practitioners to substitute the meta-model with a
concrete implementation instance of the model. This mapping is then used as the basis
to decide upon and prioritise which process areas should be implemented to achieve
specific business benefits.</p>
      <p>
        To demonstrate the implementation of the RSM in a specific instance, we investigated
available return on investment (ROI) models which did not deal exclusively with
software process improvement, but with which existing SPI models could be
combined. We chose to work with the IGSI-ISM Benefits Model [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>
        ] and CMMI
Version 1.2 [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>
        ] This is done as follows:

      </p>
      <p>Define the mapping (relationships) between Objectives/Benefits and Software
Processes</p>
      <p>Answer the questions that are relevant to the individual organization.</p>
      <p>The initial methodology, meta-model and implementation instance were developed as
described and were then reviewed by a small group of peers for validity. For
triangulation purposes, they were validated through an expert panel review of 17
people with an average work experience in the software industry of 19 years along
with an average of 11 years of SPI experience. Additionally, to validate the
implementation instance, a group of experts was interviewed about each relationship
within the RS-ICMMI model. Out of a pool of ten experts, two experts were
randomly selected to review a set of IGSI-ISM Benefit/CMMI Level 2 combinations.
They discussed whether they agreed with the relationship presented, and where they
had seen these relationships work in practice. This process was repeated until all
combinations had been reviewed. In some cases, the RS-ICMMI was modified as a
result of these interviews.

      <title>Rosetta Stone Meta-Model</title>
      <p>Many valuable studies of the benefits resulting from implementation of CMM/CMMI
and Software Process Improvement (SPI) in general have been undertaken over the
last several years. These studies have focused on SPI along one or two of three
aspects – organizational, improvement methodology, or metric-based. In contrast, our
research has developed a consolidated model which would allow practitioners to view
organization, improvement programs and metrics concurrently using one, unified
framework – a “Rosetta Stone”, if you will, of SPI.</p>
      <p>
        The Rosetta Stone meta-model is composed of 5 basic elements, as well as the
relationships between them (Figure 1), with further detail in [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>
        ].
Elements: The most important element is the set of Business Objectives or
Benefits which an organization wishes to achieve. Ideally, these should be
hierarchical so that the achievement of one leads to the achievement of others.
Relationships are defined between Business Objectives and Process Areas (PAs).
Return, Costs and ROI: it is now possible to tie SPI to specific benefits due to the
fact that the benefits may be defined at a very granular level.
The Rosetta Stone methodology is the translation process whereby an abstract
metamodel is transformed into a concrete implementation which may be readily used by
practitioners. At a high level, each abstract entity as described in Figure 1 must be
replaced with a concrete entity. Frequently the choice of both the SPI methodology
(Step 1) and benefits model (Step 2) is performed at a strategic level within an
organization. The mapping between benefits and process areas (step 3), the
determination of the implementation order (step 4) and the determination of which
metrics to use (step 5) are performed by SPI practitioners; and the monitoring of costs
and benefits (step 6) is performed by the “front-line” staff involved in the running of
projects and support organizations.
Step 1 – Choose the SPI Methodology: There are several SPI models and
methodologies currently in use within ICT and several factors influence an
organization’s decision on which SPI methodology to use. Reasons for SPI
implementation include improving the software process, external requirements such
as supplying a contract, and enabling the business in a particular market segment.
Step 2 – Choose the Benefits Model: Different organizations have different
organizational goals and missions. Some, like IBM and Microsoft, are for-profit
companies while others such as universities, charities, and local government bodies
have different goals and missions. What both the for-profit and not-for-profit
organizations have in common, however, is that both types of organization try to use
their use their resources most efficiently to achieve their organizational objectives.
Step 3 – Mapping between the SPI Methodology and the Benefits Model: One of the
core questions we asked is how do we determine the benefits associated with the
implementation of a Process Area? This is based on the Goal Question Metric (GQM)
approach [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19 ref20 ref21 ref22">19-22</xref>
        ] and is performed by creating a mapping between Goals (Business
Objectives) and Questions (Process Areas) using a reverse mapping between Process
Areas (Questions) and Business Objectives (Goals).
      </p>
      <p>Step 4 – Determine Implementation Order: This step allows us to determine which
Process Areas should be implemented, and in what order, to achieve those specific
business benefits. A prerequisite for this step is an understanding of what business
objectives an organization wishes to achieve. This understanding may come from
many sources – for example, a Six Sigma review of existing business processes.
Given that an organization knows what business objectives it wishes to achieve, it
must then use the map which was built up in Step 3 to determine which Process Areas
contribute to the desired business objective.</p>
      <p>
        Step 5 – Identification of Metrics/Indicators for Benefits: The organization has now
decided which business objectives it wishes to achieve. Each potential benefit must be
capable of being monitored in order to determine if the benefit is being received by
the organization or not. GQM [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19 ref20 ref21 ref22">19-22</xref>
        ] is a well-established methodology for defining
measurable goals and has been used to establish successful measurement programs in
industry. Specifically with regard to the Rosetta Stone Methodology, each Goal is the
analysis of a particular Benefit from the Benefits model. The Question is “what are
the objective measures which can be used to determine if a benefit is being
achieved?” and the Metrics are “what is going to be measured?”.
      </p>
      <p>Step 6 – Tracking of Costs and Returns: The final step involves tracking both the
Costs and the Returns and is operational in nature. This step will typically be
performed by the front-line staff involved in developing software such as the Project
Management Office, the development staff, and the QA staff. Note that, as this step
has not been implemented as part of this work, this step will not be discussed in
Section 5.</p>

    <sec id="sec-4">
      <title>Operationalization of the Rosetta Stone Methodology</title>
      <p>Having discussed the methodology at a high level in section 4, we now present a
specific instance of operationalizing the methodology.</p>
      <p>
        Step 1 – Choose SPI Methodology – CMMI (Staged): In this paper, we present SEI’s
CMMI (Staged) methodology [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>
        ] as the demonstration SPI. It was chosen primarily
as it is one of the most popular SPI methodologies in use today and is therefore
widely understood and used by many practitioners.
Step 2 – Choose Benefits Model – IGSI-ISM Benefits Model: Goyal at al. [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>
        ]
developed a generic for-profit benefits model, with the ultimate goal being an increase
in revenues/profits and which will appeal to a broad spectrum of for-profit
organizations – the IGSI-ISM model. This model, shown in Figure 2, determines 21
separate identifiable benefit areas1, and the relationships between them. This model is
1 We recognize that there are some benefits which are not described as we might like within
this model. An example is ‘Image’ which should read ‘Improved Image’. We have not
clarified such changes in this paper.
a hierarchy of benefits – higher level benefits are derived from elements that are
lower in the benefit tree. Not all benefits are equal and the model differentiates
between primary and secondary benefits. A primary benefit of a Process Area is one
that is brought about as a direct result of implementation of a process area where the
cause and effect relationship between the Process Area implementation and the
benefit is very strong. Secondary benefits are those benefits which have a secondary
impact or which are derived as a result of achieving another benefit. A Derived
benefit is a benefit which is a hierarchical ancestor of either a primary or secondary
benefit. For example, using Figure 2, if Better Product Quality (4-1) can be achieved,
this will lead to Increased Productivity (3-2). We refer to Better Quality Product (4-1)
as a primary benefit and Increased Productivity (3-2) as a derived benefit. As
Increased Productivity (3-2) is a derived benefit of Better Quality Product (4-1), it is
also classed as a secondary benefit
Step 3 – Map between SPI Methodology and Benefits Model: To arrive at the
mapping, each PA and its associated Generic Goals (GGs), Specific Goals (SGs), and
Sub-Processes (SPs), with [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>
        ] as the reference document, were reviewed. This
allowed us to determine which ones have particular relevance to the IGSI-ISM benefit
model. In effect, we questioned “What objectives does this PA answer?” As a
demonstration of how the mapping was created we illustrate using the CMMI Level 2
Process Area – Measurement and Analysis (MA).
      </p>
      <p>Measurement and Analysis (MA)</p>
      <sec id="sec-4-1">
        <title>Definition</title>
        <p>
          The purpose of Measurement and Analysis (MA) is to develop and sustain a
measurement capability that is used to support management information needs [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>
          ].
MA consists of 2 specific goals (SG) – the alignment of Measurement and Analysis
activities (SG1) and the obligation to provide measurement results (SG2).
Measurement and analysis of appropriate metrics is essential in order to provide
feedback to an organization on the current and potential future state of a project. SG1
provides several important specific practices (SP) to enable the benefits described
below. In particular, it provides for the specification of metrics (SP 1.2-1), the
specification of data collection and storage procedures (SP 1.3-1), and the
specification of analysis procedures (SP 1.4-1). SG2 in general provides for the
feedback loop to enable an organization to act on the results of the results obtained in
SG1.
        </p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-4-2">
        <title>Expected Benefits</title>
        <p>MA involves the creation and reporting of various metrics to support management
information needs. Such metrics will allow a project team to review important
information with regard to the progress of a project. This will allow them to adapt
their strategies to most efficiently bring a project to market. Therefore, Lower Time
to Market (5-2) is a primary beneficiary of MA. We identified Better Quality Product
(4-1) as another primary beneficiary, as product metrics such as quality are a major
factor in establishing the quality of a product. With such metrics, it is possible to alter
processes and procedures to increase the quality of products. Without the ability to
measure various facts, it would be virtually impossible to determine if a project is at
risk. Once a project team is aware of a risk, only then can they remediate the risk.
Thus MA provides a project team the ability to better manage risk. Therefore MA
provides a primary benefit to Better Risk Management (4-2). Predictability (3-4) is
also a primary benefit. This is because Predictability is gained when, over time,
accurate measurements are taken of various aspects of projects. Only when accurate
measures are available, is it possible to predict costs, times, and quality. By
developing and maintaining a measurement capability within a project and
organization, we will enable the organization to quantify various aspects of the whole
development lifecycle. This will allow the organization to see where certain elements
break down and do not live up to their full potential. As a result, the organization
should be able to make appropriate changes to projects and processes to product better
quality products, better manage risk, lower time to market, and increase predictability.
When we validated Measurement and Analysis (MA), both interviewees, based on
their experiences, agreed with the model. With regard to the impact of MA on Better
Quality Product (4-1), the first interviewee stated that, in his experience, projects that
aren’t measured tend to bow to pressures about release dates while the second
interviewee has specific experience that shows when people are aware they’re being
tracked, they change their mindsets and consequently improve the quality of the
product being produced. The second interviewee stated that MA impacts
Predictability directly. According to him, he has seen that if you don’t have historical
data then “project planning is more of an art than a science.”
The only non-derived (secondary) benefit of MA was Setting Right Customer
Expectations (3-3). This is because one of the most important factors in setting the
right customer expectations is in ensuring predictability – a product should be ready
when an organization says it should be ready. One of the main elements in aiding
predictability is the collection of metrics across various projects which will allow an
organization to create an organizational metric database. This database will aid in
increasing predictability and, as a result, help in setting the right customer
expectations.</p>
        <p>When we validated the model with two interviewees discussing each relationship, we
found that
• 10 combinations are 100% compliant with the original mapping
• 6 combinations are 50% compliant with the original mapping
• 2 combinations are 0% compliant with the original mapping
There were 6 Process Area/Benefit combinations which were 50% compliant with
expectations. In stating that there is a positive cause and effect relationship between
MA and Competitive Proposals (3-5), the second interviewee states that it makes
sense because if you measure accurately, you put just the right amount of resources in
place and therefore cut down on waste. This then leads to competitive proposals.
Again according to the second interviewee, there is a positive correlation between
MA and Skill Development Facilitation by Management (6-1). The reason that the
interviewee gives for this is that if accurate measurements are taken of the
development process and specific components are buggy, the developers writing the
buggy code may be identified and targeted training can then be given to the
developers in question. The same interviewee also states that there is a positive
correlation between MA and Teaming/Synergize (6-3) as he saw this effect in a
consulting firm he worked for when low-level measurements were being taken on a
daily basis. The second interviewee thought that there was a logical positive
relationship between MA and New Technology (6-4).</p>

The complete list for Measurement and Analysis after validation is given in Table 1.
There were 2 combinations which were 0% compliant with expectations. For the
relationship between MA and Market Reach (3-1), the second interviewee did not feel
she was competent to answer this question and, in order to be consistent with how
weak or inconclusive answers are dealt with, the answer was deemed to be a “no.” For
the relationship between MA and Improved Institutionalization of
Tools/Process/Methods, (7-1) both interviewees disagreed with expectations. The
second interviewee’s analysis was that if things are being measured and analysed,
issues (if there are any) will be seen. This may in turn lead to institutionalization of
new technology or methods in order to solve the issues.</p>
          <p>Step 4 – Determine Implementation Order: In many cases, organizations are not so
much concerned with faithfully implementing all CMMI Levels or all PAs as they are
with achieving specific results within a mature and repeatable framework. Examples
of specific results that organizations may want to achieve are Increasing Productivity
and/or Lowering Time to Market.</p>
          <p>The process to achieve this is as follows:
1. Determine which of the IGSI-ISM objectives that we wish to achieve
2. Using the IGSI-ISM model, determine which other objectives, if any, contribute
to achieving our primary objective
3. Establish which PAs contribute to both the primary and secondary objectives and
rank the PAs in order of relevance and implementation
Determine the IGSI-ISM Primary Objective to achieve. The choice of which
IGSIISM objective to aim for is usually determined for us by outside forces such as senior
management or, in some cases, external clients. For this example we discuss Lower
Time to Market (5-2).</p>
          <p>Determine IGSI-ISM objectives contribute to the Primary Objective. From the
IGSIISM model (see Figure 2), Lower Time to Market (5-2) depends on the lower-level
objectives of Skill Development Facilitation by Management (6-1), Effective
Information Management (6-2), Teaming/Synergize (6-3) and Improved
Institutionalization of Tools/Process/Methods (7-1).</p>
          <p>Determine which PAs contribute to IGSI-ISM Objectives and rank them for
implementation. Based on the full analysis of RS-ICMMI, there are several PAs
which have an effect on Lower Time to Market (5-2). Most organizations have finite
resources and so will not be able to implement them all concurrently so we are forced
to prioritize them for implementation. There are many different ways to rank them but
there are two very important factors to keep in mind when deciding on an order.
Firstly, more consideration should be given to those PAs that primarily satisfy a
particular objective. By this we mean that those PAs that satisfy an objective as a
primary objective should be given higher ranking than those that do not. For example,
both Process and Product Quality Assurance (PPQA) and Configuration Management
(CM) both help to us attain Lower Time to Market. PPQA has Lower Time to Market
as a primary objective while CM does not. As a result, PPQA should be implemented
before CM. The reasoning behind this is that PPQA fully satisfies the Lower Time to
Market objective while CM satisfies the Teaming/Synergize (6-3) objective which is
only a contributing objective to Lower Time to Market. Secondly, more consideration
should be given to those PAs that, in the Staged Model, are lower in the Stage phases.
For example, both Requirements Management and Requirements Development
directly satisfy Lower Time to Market but, as Requirements Management is a Level 2
PA, it should be undertaken before Requirements Development.</p>
          <p>Using these principles, the recommended order for implementation of four Process
Areas to improve Time to Market would be:
• Requirements Management;
• Supplier Agreement Management;
• Measurement and Analysis;
• Process and Product Quality Assurance.</p>
          <p>
            Step 5 – Identify Metrics for Benefits: Metrics which may be used to determine if an
organization is succeeding in achieving its business objectives should be identified. A
given metric may be associated with one or more benefits and a given benefit may be
associated with one or more metrics. As a result, a metric may appear as an indicator
for more than one benefit. For example, to measure the Better Quality Product (4-1),
possible metrics include defect density at various phases in the lifecycle, costs due to
lack of quality [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>The RSM methodology is a flexible and straight-forward methodology that can be
readily and easily modified by practitioners to fit their own particular needs. The
RSICMMI instance presented uses an industry-standard SPI model and is of immediate
use by practitioners with little, if any, modification. In addition, by describing in
abstract terms what a metric/indicator is, what a generic benefit/objective is, what an
SPI is, and the relationships between them, the door is open for practitioners to use
the model on whatever SPI initiative of choice they wish to implement. Finally, the
model is highly extensible in that practitioners can add their own metrics and
benefits/objectives either as replacements or in addition to the ones currently
described in the RS-ICMMI implementation instance. In short, RSM model is truly a
Rosetta Stone Methodology allowing personnel in the field to freely translate between
SPIs, Benefits/Objectives, and Metrics.</p>
