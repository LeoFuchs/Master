        <p>Over the last decade many organizations are increasingly concerned with the improvement of their hardware/software development processes. The Capability Maturity Model (CMM) and ISO9001 are well-known approaches that are applied in these initiatives. One of the major bottlenecks to the success of process improvement is the lack of business orientation. This paper reports on a process improvement initiative at Thales Naval Netherlands (TNNL). It presents an approach that has been followed to ensure a link between process improvement and business strategy. Main factors in this process improvement approach are goal decomposition and the implementation of goal-oriented measurement on three organizational levels, i.e. the business, the process and the team level.</p>

      <title>1 Introduction</title>
      <p>Thales Naval Netherlands (TNNL) creates high-tech defence solutions for naval and
ground based environments. This paper addresses a process improvement initiative in
the business unit Radar &amp; Sensors (R&amp;S) that started in 2002. This business unit has
an extensive expertise in the fields of radar, infrared, weapon control, display
technology and communications equipment.</p>
      <p>In 2001 a pre-assessment of the quality management system for the overall
hardware/software production creation process, on the basis of the new ISO9001:2000
standard, showed that the current quality system didn’t meet the new ISO
requirements. Shortcomings were identified from different ISO9001:2000 viewpoints,
respectively:
• Restricted business orientation of quality management and business process
improvement.
• Lack of control loops.
• No feedback mechanism for continuous improvement (closing the control loops).</p>
      <p>
        Confronted with the new ISO-requirements and the actual shortcomings, the
organization decided for a redesign of its quality management approaches and
business improvement programs. The two main approaches at TNNL, that had been
applied already for a period of 10 years, were respectively: ISO9001, as developed by
the International Organization for Standardization [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>
        ], and the Capability Maturity
Model (CMM) as developed by the Software Engineering Institute [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>
        ]. ISO9001 is
related to business processes and specifies the minimal requirements for a quality
system. This standard has been applied at TNNL to develop a quality management
system for the overall hardware/software production creation process. CMM
addresses explicitly concepts for continuous software process improvement. CMM
has been applied at TNNL in particular in software development departments. One
department in the R&amp;S business unit reached the CMM level 3 (out of five levels, of
that level one is the lowest and level five is the highest). This means that a reasonable
level of maturity has been reached in the development process in terms of the
formality and the structuredness of processes. Processes on level 3 are characterized
as ‘defined’. Both approaches, ISO9001 and CMM, can be considered to have
complementary philosophies regarding quality and process management [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>
        ].
However, integration or combination of the two approaches is not easy because of the
differences in business orientation, i.e. business processes in general versus software
development processes. The kernel focus for integration or combination of the two
approaches is the concept of continuous improvement. Regarding improvement
ISO9001 can be considered to have an open ‘loop control’. This means that the
actions of a business system are independent of the control system output, i.e. there is
no explicit feedback mechanism used for the tuning of actions and the continuous
improvement of them. ‘Closed loop control’, as addressed in the CMM, is based on
the application of metrics to modify actions on the basis of the control system output
[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>
        ]. It was decided at TNNL to adopt the concept of ‘closed loop control’ and to
elaborate this concept in the context of ISO9001:2000. The ‘closed loop’ concept, i.e.
its explicit feedback mechanism, implies the application of business process
measurement. Regarding measurement an approach that has been used already for a
number of years in software development environments is Goal Question Metric
(GQM) [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>
        ] [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>
        ]. GQM supports answering questions such as: how can be decided what
needs to be measured, when should this be measured and where in the product
creation process? In this way an ad-hoc and unsystematic application of metrics and
the collection of irrelevant data is avoided. In order to get grip on the measurement
problem two important assumptions are respectively (a) a metrics program should not
be ‘metrics based’ but ‘goal based’ and (b) the definition of goals and measures need
to be tailored to the individual organization. In particular the latter assumption was of
interest at TNNL to link business improvement to the business strategy [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
        ], [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>Taking into account, both the identified shortcomings of the TNNL quality
management system, and the need for measurement-based continuous improvement, a
new process improvement initiative was launched. This initiative is aimed at ensuring
a link between business strategy and the product creation process. Main issues in this
initiative are respectively goal decomposition, continuous improvement and the
development of goal-oriented measurement.</p>
      <p>The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 introduces respectively: the
business processes at TNNL, the identified problems and the directions for solution as
formulated by the TNNL management. Section 3 presents a framework that acts as a
basis of reference for the improvement initiative. Section 4 elaborates the framework
and addresses goal decomposition and the development of goal-oriented measurement
in the process improvement initiative. Examples from practice clarify the approach
that has been followed. Section 5 contains conclusions and directions for future work.

      <title>Solutions</title>
      <p>In the product creation process at TNNL two main primary process chains can be
distinguished. Chain 1 reflects development of new and derivative products. Chain 2
describes the development of repeat products. In Chain 1 the processes, in particular
requirements analysis and design, are strongly driven by specific customer
requirements. In Chain 1 the processes are driven by the characteristics of existing
product components. Both process chains are facilitated by a number of supporting
process areas. For these areas, departments have been set up to support operational
teams in the product creation process. Examples are a Configuration Management, a
Data Management, and a Human Resource department. Furthermore outsourcing is
supported explicitly. Because the main focus in the improvement initiative was on the
two primary process chains, these are presented below.</p>
      <sec id="sec-3-1">
        <title>2.1 Processes in Practice: The Chains</title>
        <p>Chain 1. The most important chain 1 processes are depicted in Figure 1. We can
distinguish Proposal &amp; Contracting, System Requirements Analysis &amp; Design,
Product Development – Integration - Verification &amp; Validation, System Integration
Verification &amp; Validation, and Warranty. Each of these processes will be described.</p>

          <p>Proposal and Contracting (P&amp;C). This process consists of activities such as the
intake of a request, i.e. the translation of requirements into a proposal, the tuning with
the product portfolio, the response to the customer, and negotiation tasks.
System Requirement Analysis and System Design (SRA/SD). In the analysis part of
this process the customer requirements are translated into a system concept that is the
basis for a complete system requirements specification. The system concept is
validated with the various stakeholders in the development process. In this process
also a feasibility estimate is established. The system design part of the SRA/SD
process refines the system concept, based on the availability of building blocks and
well-founded make or buy decisions.</p>
          <p>Product Development, Integration, Verification and Validation (PDIVV). This process
realises the system according to the agreed specifications, assigns the work to be done
to the production department or subcontractors and delivers the system components.
System Integration, Verification and Validation (SIVV). In this process the
components are integrated. The final product is verified and validated against the
original customer and system requirements.</p>
          <p>Warranty. Regarding the warranty period of a product, activities are specified for
system acceptation, receiving customer complaints on product failure, investigating
defects and repairing defects.</p>
          <p>Chain 2. The chain 2 processes describe the product creation activities of repeat
products (see Figure 2). The Proposal, Contracting, and Warranty processes in this
Chain are identical to those in Chain 1 and need no further introduction. The
remaining processes are described below.</p>

product and of the validation of these changes. If reengineering is required of some
parts of a product several sub processes or activities of chain 1 (mainly from the
processes SRA/SD, PDIVV, SIVV) can be applied.</p>

        <title>2.2 Problems and Directions for Improvement</title>
        <p>In 2001 an independent quality assessment at TNNL based on the ISO9001:2000
standard was carried out. In this assessment the two primary process chains have been
investigated together with the facilitating areas. ISO9001:2000 in particular
emphasizes, in comparison with the previous ISO9001 standard:
• Business processes should be the basis for quality management. In particular
those processes should be addressed in a quality management system, that are of
critical importance for the business system as a whole,
• A quality management system explicitly focussed on continuous improvement, as
opposed to the more static view of the previous standard,
• This continuous improvement should be (visibly) based on formal measurement,
• Management should be explicitly involved in the design and implementation of
the quality management system.</p>
        <p>The assessment results were summarized in three major problems that will be
addressed below. For each of the problems the TNNL management defined a
direction for improvement. The result is depicted below.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-3-3">
        <title>Problem:</title>
        <p>There is a lack of insight in the
critical parts of business
processes. This is in particular
caused by the absence of a
clear link between primary
processes and the business
strategy.</p>
        <p>Continuous improvement, i.e.
the specification, execution and
control of improvement
activities, is insufficiently
addressed. In fact the emphasis
in the current quality
management system is on the
specification of procedures for
operational processes.</p>
        <p>Developing and implementing
an improvement initiative is a
process of organizational
change. Until now the
employees have not been
involved sufficiently in the
process of quality management</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-3-4">
        <title>Improvement action:</title>
        <p>
          The management at TNNL decided to introduce goal
decomposition starting at the level of business
strategy down to the level of primary processes and
operational teams. In the improvement initiative only
those processes, and their interrelations, will be
addressed that contribute explicitly to the business
strategy, see [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
          ].
        </p>
        <p>
          It has been decided that feedback and control loops
will be developed and implemented to establish
continuous improvement. These continuous
improvement loops will be based on quantitative
measurement. Implementation of continuous
improvement into the business processes will be
supported by the application of intranet-based tools,
e.g. regarding the definition of metrics, the collection
and analysis of data, and the definition of
improvement activities, see [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
          ].
        </p>
        <p>
          The management decided to carefully plan and
control the new improvement initiative. The entire
organization should understand the importance of
continuous improvement. Therefore awareness on the
importance of process improvement should be raised
and operational teams should play a central role in the
determination of their own improvement goals, which
have to be derived from business and process
improvement goals, see [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>
          ].
2.3
        </p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-3-5">
        <title>A Framework for the Improvement Initiative</title>
        <p>
          Starting from the defined directions for improvement a framework has been
developed to support the improvement initiative, see Figure 3. In this pyramid three
management levels are recognized to link the improvement initiative to the business
system, respectively the strategic, the tactical, and the operational level [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
          ].
        </p>
        <p>The Strategic Plan is positioned in the strategic top layer of the pyramid and acts as
a basis for both a Process Management System (PMS) and a Quality Management
System (QMS). In this plan management issues are addressed such as:</p>
        <sec id="sec-3-5-1">
          <title>The long-term vision of the management,</title>
          <p>The mission statement, and
Organisational development issues.</p>

O</p>
          <p>Tactical QCuaolcitkypPitlan</p>
          <p>The PMS secures the product creation process. On the tactical level the product
creation processes are described according to the two process chains (chain 1 for new
products and chain 2 for repeat products). The processes are described by means of a
format with guidelines regarding respectively: the description of the stakeholders of a
process (such as the customer, the supplier, the owner), the process flow aspects (such
as input, activities, output), and the performance of a process (such as process goals,
improvement actions and metrics). For all processes a general description and detailed
information (e.g. action lists) are available. On the operational level also supporting
information is available such as checklists, templates, guidelines and best practices.</p>
          <p>The QMS supports in particular the continuous (quality) improvement of the
product creation process. Continuous quality improvement is based on goal
decomposition, i.e. from business goals on the strategic level to process improvement
and team improvement goals on the operational level. Regarding quality management,
the Quality Plan and the so-called ‘cockpit’ are important concepts.</p>
          <p>The Quality Plan, on the tactical level of the framework, forms a basis for the
determination of improvement goals. The Quality Plan starts from the business
strategy and specifies respectively the actual vision on continuous improvement, the
short-term improvement goals and the accompanying improvement actions. The
progress of the improvement program is monitored on the basis of performance
indicators in the so-called management cockpit. The cockpit will be addressed in
detail in section 4. Cockpit review by the management team takes place monthly. The
Quality Plan is subject to management review at least twice a year.</p>

      <title>3 Towards Goal-Oriented Improvement</title>
      <p>
        The pyramid framework acts as a reference for the development and implementation
of the improvement initiative. To develop the improvement initiative three important
principles were taken from results of recent research in the domain of business
improvement, respectively:
• Goal decomposition; business goals should be derived from overall business
strategy. Based on these business goals operational process and team
improvement goals have to be defined [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
        ], [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>
        ], [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>
        ]. Both for business goals and for
process improvement and team improvement goals, improvement actions have to
be defined.
• Metric-based improvement. Management and control of improvement actions
should be based on measurement. For each business goal, process improvement
goal and team improvement goal a (set of) metric(s) has to be defined to be able
to quantitatively control the effectiveness of improvement actions [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>
        ], [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>
        ].
• The decomposition of business goals into process improvement goals and team
improvement goals, and the definition of metrics should be based on the needs
and the requirements of the operational teams, that can be considered to be the
main the stake-holders in the primary business processes [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>
        ], [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>In accordance with these principles the improvement initiative was reformulated as
a goal-oriented improvement initiative.</p>
      <sec id="sec-4-1">
        <title>3.1 Goal-Oriented Improvement in the Business Model of TNNL</title>
        <p>Starting from the pyramid framework the goal orientation in the improvement
initiative has been elaborated into a high-level business model, see Figure 4.</p>
        <p>In this business model the PMS is depicted as a horizontal dimension that reflects
the transformation of materials and sub-products into products via process chains. It is
aimed at maintaining operational control. The vertical dimension addresses the QMS,
and is aimed at continuous improvement of the operational business processes. As
stated before, in the horizontal PMS the operational processes and their interfaces are
specified, authorities and responsibilities are defined, business rules e.g. for delivery
on time are specified, etc. In the vertical dimension the improvement of processes,
sub-processes and teams has to be managed (the QMS).</p>
        <p>In order to link the business strategy (the vision and the mission statements of the
management) to the product creation process, the business strategy is refined in terms
of business goals and associated sub-goals. Subsequently process improvement and
team improvement goals are derived. Based on this goal decomposition, improvement
actions are defined both on the business level, the process level and the team level. To
plan and control continuous improvement in the business model the plan-do-check-act
cycle concept is implemented on the different levels of the goal hierarchy. For the
sake of clarity of Figure 4 the plan-do-check-act cycle is only drawn in this figure on
the lower level of the model. Of course the feedback mechanisms should also include
feedback on the quality of the improvement goals itself. The lower layer teams should
also report feedback about the quality of the higher-level process improvement goals,
and the lower level processes should also report on the quality of the higher-level
business goals.</p>
        <p>To control the effectiveness of the improvement actions their efficiency and
adequacy has to be measured. On the strategic level the business strategy is defined.
On the tactical level business goals and performance indicators are defined which are
derived from the business strategy. For each business goal one or more metrics are
defined. Subsequently the business goals are decomposed into process improvement
and team improvement goals. Also for these process improvement and team
improvement goals, metrics are to be defined.</p>

        <p>The decomposition of business strategy and business goals into process and team
improvement goals, and the definition of accompanying metrics is not a
straightforward, formal or deterministic process. Consensus building and
intersubjective decision-making is central. Therefore relevant stakeholders have to be
involved in this process of goal decomposition, improvement action definition and
metric determination. Stakeholders are parties that play a direct or indirect role in the
product creation process. They can be both operational teams that develop the
products, external customers, internal customers who use the output or deliver the
input to a process. To organise this stakeholder involvement, workshops, brainstorm
meetings and training sessions have to be planned carefully.</p>
        <p>In the following section the development of this goal oriented improvement
concept at TNNL will be presented. Here, concepts of goal decomposition and
measurement play a central role. Regarding the involvement of stakeholders, we will
focus on the operational teams that execute the actual process improvement goal
decomposition, the team improvement goal definition and the metrics determination.</p>

      <title>Development of Goal Oriented Business Improvement at TNNL</title>
      <p>This section presents the approach that was followed and the (intermediate) results
that were reached. Three phases can be recognized:
• A phase where top management defines the strategy, the business goals, business
sub-goals, the performance indicators and the metrics, see the upper layers of
Quality Management in Figure 4.
• A second phase in that the process improvement goals and the accompanying
metrics are defined, see the lower layer of Quality Management in Figure 4, and
• A third phase in that the team improvement goals and metrics are defined (see
also the lower layer of Quality Management in Figure 4).</p>
      <p>In section 4.1 for the first phase only the results of the management discussions and
the decisions that were made are reported. In fact this was a ‘black box’ strategic
management process where only the outcome can be presented. Section 4.2 reports on
a procedure that has been developed for process improvement definition and gives
some examples of process improvement goals and metrics that have been defined. In
section 4.3 the process of the definition of team improvement goals and metrics is
described. This process is also clarified with practical examples.</p>
      <sec id="sec-5-1">
        <title>4.1 Phase 1: Business Strategy, Objectives, and Performance Indicators</title>
        <p>The high level management has defined five strategic objectives in the Management
Handbook. These statements are based on the strategic objectives of TNNL and are
taken as starting points for the development of the improvement initiative within the
particular business unit R&amp;S/JRS. The strategic objectives are respectively:
• Adequate profitability
• Delivering customer-oriented solutions
• Being the employer of choice
• Developing both existing and new markets
• Adequate and efficient knowledge- and technology management</p>
        <p>These rather abstract objectives have been elaborated to make them more
applicable on the tactical level or business level, see Table 2.</p>
        <p>In order to measure whether or not these strategic objectives are met management has
identified five performance indicator areas (PIA’s). See also Table 3.
These five performance indicator areas are displayed in a so-called management
cockpit that acts as a control mechanism to keep track of the improvement results.
The management cockpit will be addressed further in the following of this section.</p>
        <p>Strategic objectives and associated performance indicator areas act as guidelines.
Using these, associated business goals and metrics can be derived. For each PIA a
number of business goals can be defined, see Table 4.
The metrics can be used to decide whether or not specific business goals are reached,
and subsequently what the score is of a particular PIA in the management cockpit at
the strategic level. A distinction is made between hard and soft metrics, or
quantitative and qualitative measures. A hard metric gives formal figures (e.g. illness
rate, due date performance and spending rate). Soft metrics express confidence or
satisfaction (e.g. confidence that goods will be delivered in time, confidence that the
quality of baselines in the product creation process are adequate, customer satisfaction
and employer satisfaction). Usually both types of metric are required to provide
sufficient information. We give in table 5 some examples of metrics for the PIA’s
Efficient and Effective Product Creation Process, Customer-oriented Solutions, and
Employees.</p>
        <p>Business goal: reliability of product delivery.</p>
        <p>Metric: in-time delivery with respect to operation planning.</p>
        <p>Norm 80%.
• Business goal: customer confidence in critical process interfaces.
• Metric: appreciation score of the key stakeholders in the process, measurement
based on questionnaire.
• Norm: &gt;7.</p>
        <p>Example 2
Performance indicator area: Customer-oriented Solutions.
• Business goal: customer requirements specification (CRS) match with TNNL
product characteristics.
• Metric: number of adjustments of CRS required with respect to existing product
portfolio characteristics.
• Norm: &lt; 1.25*(reference data from experience base)/time.</p>
        <p>Example 3
Performance indicator area: Employees.</p>
        <p>Business goal: motivated employees.</p>
        <p>Metric-1: staff turnover, norm: 5 %.</p>
        <p>Metric-2: Average number of overtime hours per employee.</p>
        <p>Norm: &lt; x-hours per person.</p>
        <p>Based on the application of the metrics, periodically the PIA-scores are being
generated per performance indicator area (PIA) and shown in the management
cockpit, as depicted in figure 5.</p>
        <p>Based on the PIA-scores that are presented in the management cockpit the
management can evaluate their strategic objectives. Subsequently the business goals
act as starting points for improvements that have to be carried out on the process and
the team level. In the next section the decomposition of the business goals into
process improvement goals and the determination of accompanying metrics is
presented.
Starting from the business goals the areas in the product creation process have to be
identified where specific (parts of the) processes should be improved. These
improvements are then defined as process improvement goals. Each goal at the
process level has to be provided with one or more metrics.</p>

        <p>The decomposition of the business goals into process improvement goals for the
operational teams on the one hand and facilitating departments on the other hand is
performed in the following steps:
1. Per process of the product creation process a small team of stakeholders in the
process is formed.
2. Each team makes an inventory of the improvement needs of the process and
translates these needs into process improvement goals.
3. The process improvement goals are linked with one or more business goals.</p>
        <p>Goals that cannot be linked with any business goal are rejected.
4. The remaining process improvement goals are subdivided into three classes:
a. Process improvement goals that can be assigned to operational teams,
which execute the process.
b. Process improvement goals on the interface between processes.
c. Process improvement goals to be assigned to the departments, which
facilitate the operational teams.</p>
        <p>In the following paragraphs we will give some examples of the determination of
process improvement goals. Because we restrict ourselves in this paper for the sake of
clarity to the operational processes as stated in section 1, we will address in these
examples only process improvement goals of the processes themselves and process
improvement goals at the interface of processes. The process of that we will focus on
in this example is the Product Development, Integration, Verification and Validation
(PDIVV) process, see Figure 1 in section 2.1.</p>
        <p>The PDIVV Process and its Stakeholders. The PDIVV process is a process in
chain-1 that produces the system according to the agreed specifications, assigns the
work to be done to the production department or subcontractors and delivers the
system components, see section 1. The PDIVV process has interfaces with the
processes SRA/SD and SIVV, which are considered as the most important
stakeholders, together with the PDIVV-employees. The output of the SRA/SD
process, and the input of PDIVV, is a validated and complete system requirements
specification that is based on the availability of building blocks within TNNL. The
output of PDIVV, and the input for SIVV, is a produced system and/or components
that have to be integrated into a final product in the SIVV process. The final product
is verified and validated against the original customer and system requirements. In the
following table 6 we give examples of process improvement goals with respect to
respectively the operational teams, the SRA/SD interface and the SIVV interface.
Process improvement goals with respect to the operational teams executing the process.</p>
        <p>Process improvement goal: executing the work in accordance with the project plan.
• Related business improvement goal: efficient and effective product creation
process (see 4.1).</p>
        <p>• Metric: procentual time delay (t-real – t-plan)/t-real).</p>
        <p>Process improvement goal: constructive feedback on personal performance.</p>
        <p>• Related business improvement goal: improve the motivation of employees (see
4.1)
• Metric: questionnaire to determine a score for employee satisfaction regarding
their interaction with Resource Management.</p>
        <p>Process improvement goals with respect to the SRA/SD (interface at the input side)
Process improvement goal: improve the stability of the system requirements
specification.</p>
        <p>• Related business improvement goal: improve reliability of product delivery
(see 4.1)
• Metric: changes over a period of time in (#requirements to work on)/
(#requirements total).</p>
        <p>Process improvement goals with respect to the SIVV (interface at the output side)
Process improvement goal: improve satisfaction of the SIVV employees on the
quality of the output by increasing frequency of reviews.</p>
        <p>• Related business improvement goal: satisfied (internal) customer (see 4.1).
• Metric: (effort/time needed to react to complaints from SIVV)/(effort/time
needed for the development of the output).</p>

        <title>Goals and the Definition of Metrics</title>
        <p>The decomposition of the strategic objectives via the business goals into process
improvement goals and the definition of accompanying metrics form the basis for
actual business improvement. The improvement goals have to be embedded in the
daily work of the operational teams. This section reports on the way workshops are
carried out to determine team goals and metrics. The team improvement goals and
metrics are registered in the QMS and serve there as a basis of reference for the
dayto-day work of the various operational teams.</p>
        <p>Workshop Objectives. The implementation of process improvement goals into the
work of operational teams was supported by workshops. The objectives of the
workshops for individual teams were to define its own set of team improvement
goals, on the basis of on the one hand the process improvement goals, and on the
other hand the teams own particular project objectives and the individual experiences
of each team member. Team improvement goals can be related to one or more process
improvement goals; just like process improvement goals can be related to one or more
business goals.</p>
        <p>Workshop Design. The workshops are being designed carefully in accordance with
the size of the teams, which varies between 6 and 25 persons. The approach is to
reach agreement on team improvement goals via dialog and mutual understanding.
For a workshop relevant process improvement goals are pre-selected and act as a
basis of reference during the whole workshop. The starting questions of a workshop
are respectively:
• ‘How do we contribute to the process improvement goals of the department’,
• ‘How do we measure team contribution’, and
• ‘What are individual roles in that’?</p>
        <p>
          Subgroups of three to five persons are formed to discuss process improvement and
team goals, both in parallel and sequential. They are provided with predefined
templates that are based on the ‘cockpit’ and with the Goal Question Metric paradigm
[
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>
          ]. Team members can participate in more than one (sequentially) operating
subgroup. Several iterations are used to derive team improvement goals and metrics
from process improvement goals. The group's outcomes are reviewed each iteration
by other subgroups. Finally, based on consensus building, the most suitable team
goals and metrics are selected, and an action plan is proposed. Based on the iterations,
the review mechanisms and the changing groups, maximum use of the variety of a
team is reached, creating a large cohesion within the operational team.
Workshop Evolution. Over a period of eighteen months, monthly follow-up sessions
are organized. In these sessions experiences are collected regarding the fit of the
process improvement goals with the team improvement goals and the application of
the team improvement goals and the metrics in practice.
        </p>
        <p>Preliminary Workshop Results. Some examples of the results of the workshops are:
• Explicit team improvement goal definition provides teams with a clear focus on
the major topics of their work
• Increased awareness of the teams on the impact of their work on the business as a
whole. It provided teams with a "helicopter view" on their daily work.
• Clear contribution to the "team spirit" of the employees.</p>
        <p>Redesign of particular activities in the team, e.g. improving the efficiency of the
work
Follow-up workshops showed that specific important improvement topics could
be kept on the agenda and didn’t tend to disappear due to the day-to-day worries.
Some Examples of Metrics. In Table 7 two examples are given of the determination
of team improvement goals, metrics and norms, on the basis of the process
improvement goals as defined in section 4.2. For each of the examples a brief
experience issue is given.
A pre-assessment on the basis of the ISO9001:2000 standard at TNNL showed
shortcomings regarding quality management and continuous improvement. To
improve the situation the management decided to set up an improvement initiative.
Regarding the structure of this improvement initiative, a framework for goal-oriented
quality improvement has been defined. Based on this framework, three directions for
solving the problems have been defined, i.e. goal decomposition, metrification and
stakeholder involvement. Regarding improvement three levels of improvement
actions have been elaborated, respectively the business level, the process
improvement level and the team improvement level. On each of these levels
appropriate stakeholders played a role in the determination of metrics, e.g. top
management, project or process leaders, and operational team members. Appropriate
defined metrics, related to the improvement actions of a particular level, are used to
determine the effectiveness of the improvement actions on a continuous basis. On the
team level the team improvement goal definition and the determination of metrics is
performed in workshops that are organized on a regular basis. Finally the evaluation
of the improvement goals and the application of the metrics, e.g. the collection and
the analysis of data, are supported by web-based intranet tools.</p>
