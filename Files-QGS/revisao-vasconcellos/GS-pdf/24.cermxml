        <p>Over the last decade many organizations are increasingly concerned with the improvement of their hardware/software development processes. The Capability Maturity Model and ISO9001 are well-known approaches that are applied in these initiatives. However, one of the major bottlenecks to the success of process improvement is the lack of business goal orientation. Additionally, business-oriented improvement approaches often show a lack of process orientation. This paper reports on a process improvement initiative at Thales Naval Netherlands that attempts to combine the best of both worlds, i.e. process improvement and business goal orientation. Main factors in this approach are goal decomposition and the implementation of goal-oriented measurement on three organizational levels, i.e. the business, the process and the team level. q 2004 Elsevier B.V.

      <title>1. Introduction, background and approach</title>
      <p>Thales Naval Netherlands (TNNL) creates high-tech
defence solutions for naval and ground based
environments. This paper addresses a process improvement
initiative in the business unit Radar and Sensors (R&amp;S)
that started in 2002. This business unit has an extensive
expertise in the fields of radar, infrared, weapon control,
display technology and communications equipment.
Products that are being developed and manufactured
here can be typed as software intensive systems
(embedded systems).</p>
      <p>A pre-assessment of the quality management system for
the overall hardware/software production creation process,
on the basis of the new ISO9001:2000 standard, showed that
the quality system did not meet the new ISO requirements.
Shortcomings were identified from different ISO9001:2000
viewpoints, respectively:
† Restricted business orientation of quality management
and business process improvement.
† Lack of control loops.
† No structured feedback mechanisms for continuous
improvement (i.e. closing the control loops).</p>
      <p>Confronted with the new ISO-requirements and the
actual shortcomings, the organization decided for a redesign
of its quality management approach and business
improvement program. This paper reports on an improvement
initiative that has been carried out. Both the steps that have
been made and the main results gained will be presented.</p>
      <p>The problems identified at TTNL can all be related to the
lack of a comprehensive goal and process
improvementoriented control mechanism. This means that the theoretical
background for this research can be found in the areas of
process improvement and goal orientation. Each of these
areas will be discussed briefly.</p>
      <sec id="sec-1-1">
        <title>1.1. Ad process improvement</title>
        <p>
          The two improvement approaches that have been
applied, already for a period of 10 years at TNNL, are
respectively: ISO9001, as developed by the International
Organization for Standardization [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>
          ], and the Capability
Maturity Model (CMM) as developed by the Software
Engineering Institute [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>
          ]. ISO9001 is related to business
processes and specifies the minimal requirements for a
quality system. This standard has been applied at TNNL to
develop a quality management system for the overall
hardware/software production creation process. CMM
addresses explicitly concepts for software process
improvement. CMM has been applied at TNNL, in particular in
software development departments. One department in the
R&amp;S business unit reached the CMM level 3 (out of five
levels, of that level 1 is the lowest and level five is the
highest). This means that a reasonable level of maturity has
been reached in terms of the formality and the
structuredness of the processes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both approaches, ISO9001 and CMM, can be considered
to have complementary philosophies regarding quality and
process management [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>
          ]. However, integration or
combination of the two approaches is not easy because of the
differences in business orientation, i.e. business processes in
general versus software development processes. Regarding
improvement, ISO9001 can be considered to have an open
‘loop control’. This means that the actions in a business
system are independent of the control system output, i.e.
there is no explicit feedback mechanism used for the tuning
of actions against well-formulated business goals. In CMM,
improvement is based on the application of metrics to
modify actions [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>
          ]. Although, CMM prescribes different
types of processes and the application of metrics in process
improvement, it lacks well-defined improvement goals on a
business level. In fact, CMM’s software process
improvement has no starting or anchor points in business goal
decomposition, from the strategic level towards the lower
operational process levels.
        </p>
        <p>Summarizing, it can be stated that both ISO9001 and
CMM have a strong emphasis on business processes and
measurement. However, both approaches are strongly
restricted regarding the motivation of process improvement
activities. In other words: these approaches are missing
well-defined business goals as anchor points for process
improvement. Summarizing, we can conclude that these
approaches have a serious lack of business goal orientation.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-1-2">
        <title>1.2. Ad goal orientation</title>
        <p>
          From literature, several ‘goal-oriented’ approaches for
business improvement have been investigated. In Ref. [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>
          ],
a formalized model is presented for linking different types
of objectives in an organization, i.e. fundamental objectives,
process objectives and functional objectives. Although a
basis is given for the identification and decomposition of
objectives, a direct link with (the control of) business
processes is not elaborated. Two other well-known
approaches are respectively, Six-Sigma [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>
          ] and Balanced
Scorecard (BSC) [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>
          ]. Both approaches offer frameworks for
business improvement. Six Sigma focuses at the
improvement of customer satisfaction through defect elimination
and prevention. Project selection and tracking focus on
maximizing the benefits delivered to the business. Project
success is measured in financial terms. Central in the BSC
approach is a measurement system that prescribes the usage
of pre-defined quantitative metrics from four business goal
domains, respectively: financial, customers, internal
business process and learning and growth. Companies
should measure in order to ‘balance’ the business from a
financial perspective.
        </p>
        <p>The improvement approaches in the foregoing start from
business goal definition and goal decomposition and are
oriented on quantitative performance measurement. They
offer frameworks for improvement, starting from business
strategy, pre-defined types of business goals and pre-defined
type of metrics. However, the link with the operational
processes is missing. The emphasis in these approaches is
much more on goal-oriented assessment of the various
business domains of a company than on metric-based
improvement of the operational product creation processes.
Summarized, we came to the conclusion that these
approaches had a serious lack of process improvement
orientation.</p>
        <p>We can conclude from these brief surveys that, although
the individual activities are well researched, in literature
little support can be found for the problem area identified at
TNNL, that of explicitly linking process improvement to a
business goal-oriented control mechanism. This paper tries
to contribute to this perceived problem area.</p>
        <p>Taking into account the identified shortcomings of the
TNNL quality approaches, i.e. the restricted business goal
orientation, and the investigated state-of-the-art
improvement approaches, i.e. the restricted process improvement
orientation, a new improvement initiative at TNNL was
launched. This initiative is aimed at ensuring a link between
business strategy and improvement of the product creation
process. Main issues in this process improvement initiative
are respectively:
† A stepwise decomposition of the overall business goals
(not restricted to one particular business aspect, such as
finance).
† A definition of organization-specific metrics (both
qualitative and quantitative).
† The interrelations between on the one hand goals and
metrics, and on the other hand business processes.</p>
        <p>
          Regarding these three issues, the concept of ‘closed loop
control’ is adopted and this concept was elaborated in the
context of ISO9001:2000. The ‘closed loop’ concept, i.e. its
explicit feedback mechanism, implies the definition of
business goals and the application of business process
measurement. Regarding measurement, an approach that
has been used already for a number of years in software
development environments is Goal Question Metric (GQM)
[
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8 ref9">8,9</xref>
          ]. GQM supports answering questions such as: how to
decide what needs to be measured, when should this be
measured and where in the product creation process? In this
way, an ad-hoc and unsystematic application of metrics and
the collection of irrelevant data is avoided. In order to get
grip on the measurement problem, two important
assumptions respectively are (a) a metrics program should not be
‘metrics based’ but ‘goal based’ and (b) the definition of
goals and measures need to be tailored to the individual
organization. In particular the latter assumption was of
interest at TNNL in order to link the business improvement
initiative to the business strategy.
        </p>
        <p>The approach that has been chosen to develop and
implement the improvement project is a combination of a
well-founded case study and empirical research. TNNL
management definitely wanted an approach that started
from specific characteristics of their business system, e.g.
the way they had defined business strategy, the way they
looked at improvement, the way business processes had
been specified and the needs they had regarding the
definition of performance indicators and metrics.</p>
        <p>It was decided that first there would be a focus on
(re)modelling the business processes. Formal process
models were considered to be necessary on the one hand
to establish a concrete context for business goal formulation
on the strategic level, and on the other hand to identify
business problems on a process and/or a team level. The
specification of the process models would be based on an
investigation of existing (and up-to-date) process
documents at TNNL and on interviews with process owners.</p>
        <p>Subsequently, a framework for improvement will have to
be established that integrates the improvement activities on
the different organizational levels, respectively, the
strategic, the tactical and the operational level. This framework
is needed to create a coherent overview on all the
improvement aspects. For example, on each of the
organizational levels, improvement goals and metrics will
be defined with their interrelations within and between the
levels. The development of the upper level of the
improvement framework will be the result of a brainstorm
session in that the top-management, some representatives of
the process owners and the researchers participate.
Regarding the definition of the process and team improvement
goals, and the metrics, several workshops will have to be
organized that will be moderated by a main process owner
in close cooperation with one researcher.</p>
        <p>Finally, the development of automated tools had to be
planned, in order to be able to manage all the data that are
going to be produced, collected, stored, and analyzed.</p>
        <p>The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2
introduces respectively: the business processes at TNNL, the
identified problems and the directions for solution as
formulated by the TNNL management. Section 3 presents
a framework that acts as a basis of reference for the
improvement initiative. Section 4 elaborates on the
framework and addresses goal decomposition and the development
of goal-oriented measurement in the process improvement
initiative. Examples from practice clarify the approach that
has been followed. Section 5 addresses the web-based tool
support for the improvement initiative. Section 6 finalises the
paper with conclusions, lessons learned and directions for
future work.</p>

      <title>2. Business processes at TNNL: practices, problems and solutions</title>
      <p>In the product creation process at TNNL two main
primary process chains can be distinguished. Chain 1
reflects the development of new and derivative products.
Chain 2 describes the development of repeat products. In
chain 1 the processes, in particular requirements analysis
and design, are strongly driven by specific customer
requirements. In chain 2 the processes are driven by the
characteristics of existing product components. Both
process chains are facilitated by a number of supporting
process areas. For these areas, departments have been set up
to support operational teams in the product creation process.
Examples are a Configuration Management, a Data
Management, and a Human Resource department.
Furthermore outsourcing is supported explicitly. Because the main
focus in the improvement initiative was on the two primary
process chains, these are presented in Table 1.</p>
      <sec id="sec-2-1">
        <title>2.1. Processes in practice: the chains</title>
        <p>Both chains consist of a number of related processes that
will be described briefly.</p>
        <p>Chain 1. The most important chain 1 processes are
depicted in Fig. 1. We can distinguish Proposal,
Contracting, System Requirements Analysis, System Design,
Product Development-Integration-Verification and
Validation, System Integration-Verification and Validation,
and Warranty. Each of these processes will be described
in the following.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-2-2">
        <title>Proposal and Contracting (P&amp;C). This process consists</title>
        <p>of activities such as the intake of a request, i.e. the
translation of requirements into a proposal, the tuning with
the product portfolio, the response to the customer, and
negotiation tasks.</p>
        <p>System Requirement Analysis and System Design
(SRA/SD). In the analysis part of this process the customer
requirements are translated into a system concept that is the
basis for a complete system requirements specification. The
system concept is validated with the various stakeholders in
the development process. In this process also a feasibly
estimate is established. The system design part of the
SRA/SD process refines the system concept, based on the
availability of building blocks and well-founded make or
buy decisions.</p>

There is a lack of insight in the critical parts of business processes. This is in
particular caused by the absence of a clear link between primary processes
and the business strategy
Continuous improvement, i.e. the specification, execution and control of
improvement activities, is insufficiently addressed. In fact the emphasis in
the current quality management system is on the specification of procedures
for operational processes
Developing and implementing an improvement initiative is a process of
organizational change. Until now the employees have not been involved
sufficiently in the process of quality management
according to the agreed specifications, assigns the work to
be done to the production department or subcontractors and
delivers the system components.</p>

      <sec id="sec-2-4">
        <title>System Integration, Verification and Validation (SIVV).</title>
        <p>In this process the components are integrated. The final
product is verified and validated against the original
customer and system requirements.</p>
        <p>Warranty. Regarding the warranty period of a product,
activities are specified for system acceptation, receiving
customer complaints on product failure, investigating
defects and repairing defects.</p>
        <p>Chain 2. The chain 2 processes describe the product
creation activities of repeat products (Fig. 2). The
Proposal, Contracting, and Warranty processes in this
Chain are identical to those in Chain 1 and need no
further introduction. The remaining processes are
described below.</p>

        <p>
          In these processes activities are carried out such as the
determination of changes that have to be made to an existing
product and of the validation of these changes. If
reengineering is required of some parts of a product several
sub processes or activities of chain 1 (mainly from the
processes SRA/SD, PDIVV, SIVV) can be applied.
Improvement action
The management at TNNL decided to introduce goal decomposition
starting at the level of business strategy down to the level of primary
processes and operational teams. In the improvement initiative only those
processes, and their interrelations, will be addressed that contribute
explicitly to the business strategy, see Ref. [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
          ]
It has been decided that feedback and control loops will be developed and
implemented to establish continuous improvement. These continuous
improvement loops will be based on quantitative measurement.
Implementation of continuous improvement into the business processes
will be supported by the application of intranet-based tools, e.g. regarding
the definition of metrics, the collection and analysis of data, and the
definition of improvement activities, see Ref. [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
          ]
The management decided to carefully plan and control the new
improvement initiative. The entire organization should understand the
importance of continuous improvement. Therefore awareness on the
importance of process improvement should be raised and operational teams
should play a central role in the determination of their own improvement
goals, which have to be derived from business and process improvement
goals, see Ref. [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>
          ]
        </p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-2-6">
        <title>2.2. Problems and directions for improvement</title>
        <p>In 2001 an independent quality assessment at TNNL
based on the ISO9001: 2000 standard was carried out. In this
assessment, the two primary process chains have been
investigated together with the facilitating areas. ISO9001:
2000 in particular emphasizes, in comparison with the
previous ISO9001 standard:
† Business processes should be the basis for quality
management. In particular those processes should be
addressed in a quality management system, that are of
critical importance for the business system as a whole;
† A quality management system explicitly focussed on
continuous improvement, as opposed to the more static
view of the previous standard;
† This continuous improvement should be (visibly) based
on formal measurement;
† Management should be explicitly involved in the design
and implementation of the quality management system.</p>
        <p>The assessment results were summarized in three major
problems. For each of the problems, the TNNL management
defined a direction for improvement. The result is depicted
below.</p>
        <p>Starting from the defined directions for improvement a
framework has been developed to support the improvement
initiative, see Fig. 3.</p>
        <p>
          In this pyramid three management levels are recognized
to link the improvement initiative to the business strategies,
respectively, the strategic, the tactical, and the operational
level [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
          ].
        </p>
        <p>The Strategic Plan is positioned in the strategic top layer
of the pyramid and acts as a basis for both a Process
Management System (PMS) and a Quality Management
System (QMS). In this plan management issues are
addressed such as:
† The long-term vision of the management,
† The mission statement, and
† Organisational development issues.</p>
        <p>The PMS secures the product creation process. On the
tactical level, the product creation processes are described
according to the two process chains (chain 1 for new
products and chain 2 for repeat products). The processes are
described by means of a format with guidelines regarding,
respectively: the description of the stakeholders of a process
(such as the customer, the supplier, the owner), the process
flow aspects (such as input, activities, output), and the
performance of a process (such as process goals,
improvement actions and metrics). For all processes a general
description and detailed information (e.g. action lists) are
available. On the operational level also supporting
information is available such as checklists, templates, guidelines
and best practices.</p>
        <p>The QMS supports in particular the continuous (quality)
improvement of the product creation process. Continuous
quality improvement is based on goal decomposition, i.e.
from business goals on the strategic level to process
improvement and team improvement goals on the
operational level. Regarding quality management, the Quality
Plan and the so-called ‘cockpit’ are important concepts.</p>
        <p>The Quality Plan, on the tactical level of the framework,
forms a basis for the determination of improvement goals.
The Quality Plan starts from the business strategy and
specifies respectively, the actual vision on continuous
improvement, the short-term improvement goals and the
accompanying improvement actions.</p>
        <p>The progress of the improvement program is monitored
on the basis of performance indicators in the so-called
management cockpit. The cockpit will be addressed in more
detail in Section 4. Cockpit review by the management team
takes place monthly. The Quality Plan is subject to
management review at least twice a year.</p>

    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-3">
      <title>3. Towards goal-oriented improvement</title>
      <p>
        The pyramid framework acts as a reference for the
development and implementation of the improvement
initiative. To develop the improvement initiative three
important principles were taken from results of recent
research in the domain of business improvement,
respectively:
† Goal decomposition. business goals should be derived
from overall business strategy. Based on these business
goals operational process and team improvement goals
have to be defined [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1 ref10 ref3">1,3,10</xref>
        ]. Both for business goals and
for process improvement and team improvement goals,
improvement actions have to be defined.
† Metric-based improvement. Management and control of
an improvement programme should be based on
measurement. For each business goal, process
improvement goal and team improvement goal a (set of) metric(s)
has to be defined to be able to quantitatively control

† The decomposition of business goals into process
improvement goals and team improvement goals, and
the definition of metrics should be based on the needs
and the requirements of the operational teams, which
can be considered to be the main stake-holders in the
primary business processes [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12 ref14">12,14</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>In accordance with these principles, the improvement
initiative was reformulated as a goal-oriented improvement
initiative.</p>
      <sec id="sec-3-1">
        <title>3.1. Goal-oriented improvement in the business model of TNNL</title>
        <p>Starting from the pyramid framework, the goal
orientation in the improvement initiative has been elaborated into
a high-level business model, see Fig. 4.</p>
        <p>In this business model, the PMS is depicted as a
horizontal dimension that reflects the transformation of
materials and sub-products into products via process chains.
It is aimed at maintaining operational control. The vertical
dimension addresses the QMS, and is aimed at continuous
improvement of the operational business processes. As
stated before, in the horizontal PMS the operational
processes and their interfaces are specified, authorities and
responsibilities are defined, business rules e.g. for delivery
on time are specified, etc. In the vertical dimension the
improvement of processes and sub-processes has to be
managed (the QMS).</p>
        <p>In order to link the business strategy (the vision and the
mission statements of the management) to the product
creation process, the business strategy is refined in terms of
business goals and associated sub-goals. Subsequently
process improvement and team improvement goals are
derived. Based on this goal decomposition, improvement
actions are defined both on the business level, the process
level and the team level of the business model.</p>
        <p>To plan and control continuous improvement in the
business model the plan – do – check – act cycle concept is
implemented on the different levels of the goal hierarchy.
For the sake of clarity of Fig. 4 the plan – do – check – act
cycle is only drawn in this figure on the lower level of
the model. Of course the feedback mechanisms should
also include feedback about the quality of the
higherlevel process improvement goals, and the lower-level
processes should also report on the quality of the
higherlevel business goals. To control the effectiveness of the
improvement actions their efficiency and adequacy has to
be measured. On the strategic level the business strategy
is defined. On the tactical level business goals and
performance indicators are defined which are derived
from the business strategy. For each business goal one or
more metrics are defined. Subsequently the business
goals are decomposed into process improvement and
team improvement goals. Also for these process and
team improvement goals, metrics are to be defined.</p>
        <p>The decomposition of business strategy and business
goals into process and team goals, and the definition of
accompanying metrics is not a straightforward, formal or
deterministic process. Consensus building and
intersubjective decision-making is central. Therefore relevant
stakeholders have to be involved in this process of goal
decomposition, improvement action definition and metric
determination. Stakeholders are parties that play a direct
or indirect role in the product creation process. They can
be both operational teams that develop the products,
external customers, internal customers who use the
output or deliver the input to a process. To organise
this stakeholder involvement, workshops, brainstorm
meetings and training sessions have to be planned
carefully.</p>
        <p>In Section 4, the development of this goal-oriented
improvement concept at TNNL will be presented. Here,
concepts of goal decomposition and measurement play a
central role. Regarding the involvement of stakeholders,
we will focus on the operational teams that execute the
actual process improvement goal decomposition, the team
improvement goal definition and the metrics
determination.</p>

    <sec id="sec-4">
      <title>4. Development of goal-oriented business improvement at TNNL</title>
      <p>This section presents the approach that was followed and
the (intermediate) results that were reached. Three phases
can be recognized:
† A phase where top management define the strategy, the
business goals and sub-goals, the performance indicators
and the metrics, see the upper layers of Quality
Management in Fig. 4.
† A second phase in that the process improvement goals
and the accompanying metrics are defined, see the lower
layer of Quality Management in Fig. 4, and
† A third phase in that the team improvement goals and
metrics are defined, see also the lower layer of Quality
Management in Fig. 4.</p>
      <p>In Section 4.1 for the first phase only the results of the
management discussions and the decisions that were made
are reported. In fact this was a ‘black box’ strategic
management process where only the outcome can be
presented. Section 4.2 reports on a procedure that has
been developed for process improvement definition and
gives some examples of process improvement goals and
metrics that have been defined. In Section 4.3, the process of
the definition of team improvement goals and metrics is
described. This process is also clarified with practical
examples.</p>
      <sec id="sec-4-1">
        <title>4.1. Phase 1: business strategy, objectives and performance indicators</title>
        <p>The high level management has defined five strategic
objectives in the Management Handbook. These statements
are based on the strategic objectives of TNNL and are taken
as starting points for the development of the improvement
initiative within the particular business unit R&amp; S/JRS. The
strategic objectives are respectively:
† Adequate profitability
† Delivering customer-oriented solutions
† Being the employer of choice
† Developing both existing and new markets
† Adequate and efficient knowledge- and technology
management</p>
        <p>These rather abstract objectives have been elaborated to
make them more applicable on the tactical level or business
level, see Table 2.</p>
        <p>In order to measure whether or not these strategic
objectives are met, management has identified five
performance indicator areas (PIA’s), see also Table 3.</p>
        <p>These five performance indicator areas are displayed in a
so-called management cockpit that acts as a control
mechanism to keep track of the improvement results. The
management cockpit will be addressed further in the rest of
this section.</p>
        <p>Strategic objectives and associated performance
indicator areas act as guidelines. Using these, associated
business goals and metrics can be derived. For each PIA a
number of business improvement goals can be defined, see
Table 4.</p>
        <p>The metrics can be used to decide whether or not specific
business improvement goals are reached, and subsequently
what the score is of a particular PIA in the management
cockpit at the strategic level. A distinction is made between
hard and soft metrics, or quantitative and qualitative
measures. A hard metric gives formal figures (e.g. illness
rate, due date performance and spending rate). Soft metrics
express confidence or satisfaction (e.g. confidence that
goods will be delivered in time, confidence that the quality
of baselines in the product creation process are adequate,
customer satisfaction and employer satisfaction). Usually
both types of metric are required to provide sufficient
information. Give in Table 5 are some examples of metrics
Example 1
Performance indicator area: efficient and effective product creation process
† Business goal: improve reliability of product delivery
† Metric: in-time delivery with respect to operation planning
† Norm: 80%
† Business goal: improve customer confidence in critical process
interfaces</p>
        <p>† Metric: appreciation score of the key stakeholders in the process,
measurement based on questionnaire</p>
        <p>† Norm: . 7
Example 2
Performance indicator area: customer-oriented solutions</p>
        <p>† Business goal: improve customer requirements specification (CRS)
regarding the match with TNNL product characteristics</p>
        <p>† Metric: number of adjustments of CRS required with respect to
existing product portfolio characteristics</p>
        <p>† Norm: , 1.25*(reference data from experience base)/time
Example 3
Performance indicator area: employees
† Business goal: improve the motivation of employees
† Metric-1: staff turnover, norm: 5%
† Metric-2: Average number of overtime hours per employee
† Norm: , x-h per person
for the PIA’s Efficient and Effective Product Creation
Process, Customer-oriented Solutions, and Employees.</p>
        <p>Based on the application of the metrics, periodically
the PIA-scores are being generated per performance
indicator area (PIA) and shown in the management
cockpit, as depicted in Fig. 5.</p>
        <p>The PIA-scores that are presented in the management
cockpit are used by the management to evaluate the strategic
objectives. Subsequently the business goals act as starting
points for improvements that have to be carried out on the
process and the team level. In Section 4.2, the
decomposition of the business goals into process improvement goals
and the determination of accompanying metrics is
presented.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-4-2">
        <title>4.2. Phase 2: decomposition of business improvement goals into process improvement goals and definition of metrics</title>
        <p>Starting from the business goals, the areas in the product
creation process have to be identified where specific (parts
of the) processes should be improved These improvements
are then defined as process improvement goals. Each goal at
the process level has to be provided with one or more
metrics.</p>
        <p>The decomposition of the business goals into process
improvement goals for the operational teams on the one
hand and facilitating departments on the other hand is
performed in the following steps:
1. Per process of the product creation process a small team
of stakeholders in the process is formed.
2. Each team makes an inventory of the improvement needs
of the process and translates these needs into process
improvement goals.
3. The process improvement goals are linked with one or
more business goals. Goals that cannot be linked with
any business goal are rejected.
4. The remaining process improvement goals are
subdivided into three classes:
a. Process improvement goals that can be assigned
to operational teams, which execute the process.
b. Process improvement goals on the interface
between processes.
c. Process improvement goals to be assigned to the
departments, which facilitate the operational
teams.</p>
        <p>In the following paragraphs, we will give some examples
of the determination of process improvement goals. Because
we restrict ourselves in this paper for the sake of clarity to
the operational processes as stated in Section 1, we will
address in these examples only process improvement goals
of the processes themselves and process improvement goals
at the interface of processes. The process that we will focus
on in this example is the Product Development, Integration,</p>
        <p>Verification and Validation (PDIVV) process, see Fig. 1 in
Section 2.1.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-4-3">
        <title>The PDIVV process and its stakeholders. The PDIVV</title>
        <p>process is a process in chain-1 that produces the system
according to the agreed specifications, assigns the work to
be done to the production department or subcontractors and
delivers the system components, see Section 1. The PDIVV
process has interfaces with the processes SRA/SD and
SIVV, which are considered as the most important
stakeholders, together with the PDIVV-employees. The
output of the SRA/SD process, and the input of PDIVV, is a
validated and complete system requirements specification
that is based on the availability of building blocks within
TNNL. The output of PDIVV, and the input for SIVV, is a
produced system and/or components that have to be
integrated into a final product in the SIVV process. The
final product is verified and validated against the original
customer and system requirements. In Table 6, we give
examples of process improvement goals with respect to
respectively, the operational teams, the SRA/SD interface
and the SIVV interface.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-4-4">
        <title>4.3. Phase 3: the decomposition of process improvement goals into team goals and the definition of metrics</title>
        <p>The decomposition of the strategic objectives via the
business goals into process improvement goals and the
definition of accompanying metrics form the basis for actual
business improvement The improvement goals have to be
embedded in the daily work of the operational teams. This
section reports on the way workshops are carried out to
determine team improvement goals and metrics. The team
improvement goals and metrics are registered in the QMS
and serve there as a basis of reference for the day-to-day
work of the various operational teams.</p>
        <p>Workshop objectives. The implementation of process
improvement goals into the work of operational teams was
supported by workshops. The objectives of the workshops
for individual teams were to define its own set of team goals
on the basis of, on the one hand, the process improvement
goals and, on the other hand, the teams own particular
project objectives and the individual experiences of each
team member. Team improvement goals can be related to
one or more process improvement goals; just like process
improvement goals can be related to one or more business
goals.</p>
        <p>Workshop design. The workshops are being designed
carefully in accordance with the size of the teams, which
varies between 6 and 25 persons. The approach is to reach
agreement on team improvement goals via dialog and
mutual understanding. For a workshop relevant process
improvement goals are pre-selected and act as a basis of
reference during the whole workshop. The starting
questions of a workshop are respectively:
† ‘How do we contribute as a team to specific process
improvement goals of the department’,
† ‘How do we measure team contribution’, and
† ‘What are individual roles in that’?</p>
        <p>
          Sub-groups of three to five persons are formed to discuss
process improvement and team goals, both in parallel and
sequential. They are provided with pre-defined templates
that are based on the ‘cockpit’ and with the GQM paradigm
[
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>
          ]. Team members can participate in more than one
(sequentially) operating subgroup. Several iterations are
used to derive team improvement goals and metrics from
process improvemet goals. The group’s outcomes are
reviewed each iteration by other sub-groups. Finally,
based on consensus building, the most suitable team goals
and metrics are selected, and an action plan is proposed.
Based on the iterations, the review mechanisms and the
changing groups, maximum use of the variety of a team is
reached, creating a large cohesion within the operational
team.
        </p>
        <p>Workshop evolution. Over a period of 18 months,
monthly follow-up sessions are organized. In these sessions
experiences are collected regarding the fit of the process
improvement goals with the team improvement goals and
the application of the team improvement goals and the
metrics in practice.</p>
        <p>Preliminary workshop results. Some examples of the
results of the workshops are:
† Explicit team improvement goal definition provides
teams with a clear focus on the major topics of their work
† Increased awareness of the teams on the impact of their
work on the business as a whole. It provided teams with a
‘helicopter view’ on their daily work.
† Clear contribution to the ‘team spirit’ of the employees.
† Redesign of particular activities in the team, e.g.</p>
        <p>improving the efficiency of the work
† Follow-up workshops showed that specific important
improvement topics could be kept on the agenda and
didn’t tend to disappear due to the day-to-day worries.
Process improvement goal: improve satisfaction of the SIVV employees on
the quality of the output by increasing frequency of reviews, see Section 4.2
† Team improvement goal: improve the quality of the specification
† Metric: objectiveness of the specification
† Norms:</p>
        <p>W . 95% of the specification is described in quantitative terms
W . 95% of the essential specification is under control (determined on
the basis of consensus of the team members)
W . 80% of non-essential requirements is under control (determined on
the basis of consensus of the team members)
Experience issue: the distinction between essential and non-essential
specifications supported the team members in getting a clear focus on main
and side aspects of the specification
† Team improvement goal: improve communication with (internal) SIVV
customers
† Metric: level of (internal) satisfaction, based on among others a number
of contacts with internal customers and formal respons given to questions
† Norm: . 6 (on a scale of 1 to 10)
Experience issue: the whole team was involved in the ‘rating’ and the team
as a whole became aware of the number of contacts with the internal
customers and the ‘quality’ of those contacts</p>
        <p>Some examples of metrics. In Table 7, two examples are
given of the determination of team improvement goals,
metrics and norms, on the basis of the process improvement
goals as defined in Section 4.2. For each of the examples a
brief experience issue is given.</p>

      <title>5. Tools to support the usage of team goals and metrics</title>
      <p>An intranet-based tool supports the usage of both the
QMS and the PMS at TNNL.</p>
      <p>On the screen in Fig. 6, the top of the pyramid consists
of the so-called Hand-Book that is in fact an
operationalisation of the Strategic Plan of the company, see Fig. 3 in
Section 2.3.</p>
      <p>By clicking one of the two Chains, in the PMS part of the
pyramid framework, the system provides the user with a
particular process model. Subsequently each process in this
process model can be clicked and for each process a
description of the main aspects of that process is given in
terms of activity, input and output, and interface
specifications. Additional information on the control and execution
of a process can be found on various tools and techniques
such as checklists, guidelines, templates and lists of best
practices. This additional information supports the user in
the development of project plans, the generation of problem
reports, etc. By clicking Norms and Standards, the system
provides the user with TNNL-specific (technical)
engineering rules, e.g. regarding the design of a particular
hardware/software product. Also checklists can be found that act
as guidance for particular activities, e.g. checklists for the
execution of reviews during the product creation process.</p>
      <p>In the QMS part of the pyramid framework, by clicking
Cockpit, the system provides the user with a Cockpit-model
that contains periodically updated Performance
Indicatorscores, see Fig. 5 (Section 4.1) These scores are related to
the strategic objectives of the company. Clicking on
‘organizational goal’, ‘process goal’, or ‘team goal’
provides the user with input/output screens such as depicted
in Fig. 7.</p>
      <p>On top of Fig. 7 a process (improvement) goal (in
Dutch: Procesdoel) is shown of a particular process, i.e.
the Engineering process of Chain 2. A few lines below
also the business goal (in Dutch: Organisatiedoel) that is
related to the process goal is reflected. For each process
improvement goal, specific actions (in Dutch:
Verbeteractie) can be defined in the lower part of the screen. In the
lower part, on the right in Fig. 7, metrics (in Dutch:
Metriek) can be defined for each process improvement
goal.</p>
      <p>Based on regular input, i.e. goals, metrics, data, the
various teams working in the two Chains can estimate
and/or calculate the effectiveness of their improvement
actions. Teams can compare their results with the results of
other teams and teams can learn form the way other teams
are dealing with process goal and metrics.</p>
      <p>Periodically the data on progress and effectiveness of
improvement actions at the process level are used by
the higher management as input for the calculation of the
PI-scores in the Cockpit.</p>
      <p>Currently the first steps have been made on the usage of
the web-based tool support. It will be clear that the company
is still climbing a learning curve regarding the usage of this
tool, the definition of metrics and the collection and analysis
of data. However, the tool provides the TNNL-employees,
on the various management levels, with an automated and
integrated support for the implementation and the evolution
of the improvement initiative at TNNL.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-6">
      <title>6. Conclusions and lessons learned</title>
      <p>A pre-assessment on the basis of the ISO9001:2000
standard at TNNL showed shortcomings regarding quality
management and continuous improvement. To improve the
situation the management decided to set up an
improvement initiative. This initiative had to based on ‘the best
from both worlds’ in business improvement approaches,
respectively metric-based process improvement and
business goal decomposition. The first lesson learned in
this project is that process improvement and business goal
decomposition approaches can be combined successfully in
practice. Based on a business improvement framework,
three directions for solving the problems have been
defined, i.e. goal decomposition, metrification and
stakeholder involvement. Regarding improvement three levels
of improvement actions have been elaborated, respectively,
the business level, the process improvement level and
the team improvement level. On each of these levels
appropriate stakeholders played a role in the determination
of metrics, e.g. top management, project or process leaders,
and operational team members.</p>
      <p>From this the second lesson learned is that an explicit
definition of improvement goals, provides stake-holders
with a clear focus on the major topics of their managerial
work and/or operational tasks. This contributes to a large
extent to the definition of appropriate metrics, related to
the improvement actions of the particular management
levels. The metrics are ultimately used to determine the
effectiveness of the improvement actions on a continuous
basis. On the team level the team improvement goal
definition and the determination of metrics is performed in
workshops that are organized on a regular basis. Finally
the evaluation of the improvement goals and the
application of the metrics, e.g. the collection and the
analysis of data, are supported by web-based intranet
tools. From this we came to our third lesson learned that
says that regarding business improvement a company has
to climb a learning curve, in particular regarding the
usage of automated tools, the definition of metrics and the
collection and analysis of data. However well-founded
automated tools can and should provide a company, on
each of the distinct management levels, with integrated
support for the implementation and the evolution of an
improvement initiative.</p>
