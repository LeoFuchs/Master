        <p>Software processes have an important role to play in realizing organizational strategies. When a software organization is about to decide on the adoption of a new process, it should have a clear understanding of its own strategic objectives, as well as the potentials of the new method in supporting or hindering its strategic plan. From this perspective, a successful process adoption initiative is one which provides maximum support to the strategic objectives of an organization while producing a minimum of adverse effects. This paper introduces the concept of Strategically Balanced Process Adoption (SBPA) for anticipating and monitoring the strategic impacts of a new process before and after its adoption. A set of techniques are proposed for the realization of SBPA, which are based on a repository of method fragments, introduced in an earlier ICSP paper. The proposed techniques are deployed in an industrial experience, where the subject organization was about to adopt a custom-designed agile process. The proposed techniques of SBPA helped the subject organization to better design the to-be process, with improved control over its enactment.</p>

process is designed (systematic SPI frameworks or ad hoc process
assembly), it is expected to improve certain strategic objectives of
organization, without producing unexpected side-effects on other
strategic objectives. Thus, when a software organization decides
on the adoption of a new development process, it should have a
clear understanding of the strategic impacts of this initiative.
However, gaining such understanding before the adoption of new
process is inherently complex, because often the strategic impacts
of a new process are visible after its actual enactment.</p>
      <p>
        In an earlier paper [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
        ], we introduced a repository of Agile
Method Fragments (AMF), with content collected through
systematic reviewing of empirical studies on agile methods.
Among the services of this repository is the provision of a list of
objectives that can be contributed (either positively or negatively)
by any agile method fragment. The repository supplies situational
evidence for every contribution relation by referencing the
empirical study that had reported the contribution relation. For
instance, for the agile method fragment Pair  Programming, the
repository states over 15 objectives (such as Reduced  Defect 
      </p>
      <sec id="sec-1-1">
        <title>Rate, Better  Time  to  Market, Increased  Productivity, etc.), and</title>
        <p>provides evidence from empirical studies where the enactment of
Pair  Programming helped or hurt the achievement of those
objectives.</p>
        <p>Leveraging the knowledge in the AMF repository, this paper
proposes a set of techniques for managing a process adoption
initiative from a strategic perspective. We introduce the concept
of Strategically Balanced Process Adoption (SBPA), as a process
adoption initiative which promotes a balance among all categories
of strategic objectives, before and after the enactment of the new
process. The SBPA is explained in two major parts:
•
•</p>
        <p>The pre-adoption analysis, which anticipates the potential
impacts of a new process over the strategic objectives of an
organization, before the adoption of the new process.</p>
        <p>The post-adoption monitoring, which investigates the actual
impacts of a new process over the strategic objectives of an
organization, after the adoption of the new process.</p>
        <p>Since September 2010 we have been involved in a Software
Process Improvement (SPI) initiative in one of the R&amp;D units of
the Ericsson Company in Italy. We joined the SPI initiative at the
time that the as-is process was analyzed. A to-be process had been
proposed to the organization, but was not yet adopted. The
proposed to-be process was mainly composed of agile method
fragments, which had experienced success in other R&amp;D units of
the organization. However, due to the particular situation of the
unit, managers had not been convinced that the new process could
help achieve their strategic objectives. The pre-adoption analysis
techniques described in this paper were introduced in that SPI
initiative to anticipate the positive and negative effects that the
new process could have for the organization. Some parts of the
results of the pre-adoption analysis are explained in this paper.
The post-adoption monitoring is still in progress - results will be
reported in the future.</p>
        <p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2
provides a brief background about the approach of Balanced
Scorecards in strategic management, from which the inspiration
for SBPA was derived. Section 3 explores the concept of balanced
process adoption, defines four techniques for pre-adoption
analysis, and explains the post-adoption monitoring. This section
also specifies the preparative steps, which are needed for strategic
analysis of a to-be software process. Section 4 illustrates the
application of pre-analysis techniques in our industrial
experience. Sections 5 and 6 discuss related work and our future
plans.</p>

      <title>2. BACKGROUND</title>
      <p>
        In the 1990’s, Kaplan and Norton introduced the concept of
Balanced Scorecards (BSC). The basic idea of BSC is to support
the strategic management of organizations, through the structuring
of portfolio strategies from different perspectives. One of the
major goals of BSC is to translate the often vague and high-level
organizational vision and mission statements into actionable and
measurable objectives that, first, are all traceable back to the high
level strategies, and second, each can be understood and
implemented by accountable staff [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>
        The BSC proposes that an organization’s strategies should be
viewed from four perspectives: (1) Financial – strategies for
profitability of an organization from shareholders’ viewpoint; (2)
Customer – strategies for creating value from customers’
perspective, (3) Internal Business Process – strategies for
improving the key business processes of the organization; (4)
Learning &amp; Growth – strategies for improving the qualifications
of individuals and growth of the corporation. The BSC suggests
that the high-level strategies of an organization (which are often
articulated as vision and mission statements) be decomposed into
actionable Objectives, categorized by the four perspectives, and
attributed with quantifiable Measures, desired Targets, and list of
supporting Initiatives [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>
        The initial concepts of the BSC approach are supported by
detailed frameworks for building and implementing particular
scorecards. A mapping technique called Strategy Maps [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>
        ] [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>
        ]
was proposed for linking strategic objectives across four
perspectives, clarifying their cause-and-effect relationships. The
      </p>
      <sec id="sec-2-1">
        <title>Balanced Scorecard Institute® proposed a framework (called</title>
        <p>
          Nine Steps to SuccessTM) for strategic planning and management.
The institute also proposed a maturity model for assessing the
quality of strategic management [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>
          ]. The model defines eight
dimensions for strategic management and proposes five levels of
maturity for each dimension.
        </p>
        <p>
          BSC has also been investigated in the context of information
systems and the software industry. Martinsons et al. [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>
          ] proposed
a customized BSC for Information Systems (IS), in which the
original BSC perspectives are substituted by business value, user
orientation, internal process, and future readiness. They argued
that the strategic goals and activities of an IS organization can be
classified into these perspectives, and proposed a number of
measures for evaluating each category. Following the original
BSC guidelines [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
          ], they stated that all of the metrics should be
quantifiable, easy to understand, and have meaningful analysis
results. Grembergen et al. [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>
          ] also proposed a customized BSC for
e-Business, which consists of four perspectives:
customerorientation, business contribution, operational excellence, and
future orientation. Each perspective is then supported by a
number of quantifiable measures. Indeed, there are many reports
of using BSC for strategic management in the software industry
[
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref11 ref8 ref9">8-11</xref>
          ].

    <sec id="sec-3">
      <title>3. BALANCED PROCESS ADOPTION</title>
      <p>The basic idea of Strategically Balanced Process Adoption
(SBPA) is inspired by the BSC, where it looks for a balanced
view of organizational strategies. One of the important problems
in the strategic management of organizations is the anticipation of
the potential impacts of organizational initiatives over the major
categories of strategic objectives. If an initiative results in the
improvement of a particular set of strategic objectives, at the cost
of uncontrolled deterioration of other sets, this initiative is
considered a kind of risk for the balance of organizational
strategies.</p>
      <p>Within the context of software organizations, the balanced view
of organization strategies highly depends to the choice of software
development process. The reason lies in the fact that software
processes are the main carrier of organizational technological
advances, as well as business success, and human-related
phenomena, all of which having significant roles in the strategic
management of a software organization. Therefore, any kind of
major change to the development process of a software
organization should be performed with respect to its potential
impacts on the strategic objectives of the organization.
The concept of SBPA is particularly important for the adoption of
software processes which are mainly built on agile method
fragments. The high emphasis of agile methods on product
aspects rather than on the process can lead the organization to
unknowingly sacrifice certain sets of strategic interests for the
sake of improving others. For example, the valuation of code over
documents is highly advocated by agile methods, and argued to
have a direct positive effect on the Productivity  of  Individuals.
However, such practices often have side effects on some other
sets of strategic objectives (e.g., negative impacts on System
Maintainability). Therefore, it is a must for a software
organization about to adopt a new development process
(particularly an agile process) to view the adoption initiative with
regard to its impacts over various categories of the organization
specific strategic objectives.</p>
      <p>To further clarify the concept of SBPA, we define Strategically
Balanced Process Adoption as an initiative with the following
attributes:</p>
      <p>It positively contributes to the strategic objectives, which
are expected to be improved.</p>
      <p>It does not cause uncontrolled negative impacts on the
strategic objectives, which are not within the focus of
improvement.</p>
      <p>It does not cause overall deterioration of a particular
category of strategic objectives, for the sake of improving
some other categories.</p>
      <p>It results in homogenous impacts over all categories of
strategic objectives.</p>
      <p>The first attribute is the minimum expectation from a SBPA,
which assures that the adoption of the new process would lead to
the improvement of the set of strategic objectives which were in
need of improvement (e.g., due to issues identified in the as-is
process); the second and third attributes seek the balance of
process adoption respectively from the perspective of every
strategic objective and every category of strategic objectives. The
last attribute of SBPA is an optional one, which specifies whether
a process adoption initiative causes proportionately similar
impacts over different categories of strategic objectives (i.e., all
categories of strategies will benefit from the initiative to a similar
extent). Further explanation of SPBA attributes are presented in
the next section.</p>
      <p>In order to explore the proper balance of a process adoption
initiative, the following questions should be answered:
How to anticipate the balance of the initiative, before the
actual enactment of new process?
How to monitor the balance of the initiative, after the
enactment of new process?
The first question is addressed as pre-adoption analysis, which
introduces four strategic analysis techniques. It investigates the
balance of process adoption at two levels: objectives and
categories, respectively exploring the improvement and the
preservation of the status of strategic objectives and categories of
strategies. The second question is addressed as post-adoption
monitoring, which as its name implies is about monitoring the
balance of initiative after the enactment of the new process.
Prior to conducting pre-adoption analysis (or post-adoption
monitoring) a set of preparative steps are required. These steps are
mainly about setting up the strategic model of the organization
and inspecting the contributions of new process over the strategic
objectives of organization. These are briefly explained in the
following two subsections.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-4">
      <title>3.1 Defining Organizational Strategies</title>
      <p>To perform the pre-adoption analysis, the organization should
have a clear understanding of its strategic objectives at different
levels, and the way these objectives would impact each other.
Indeed the strategic objectives must be categorized into
predefined categories, which represent major classes of strategies
that are important for the organization. The categorization of
strategic objectives is represented by the following relation:
Categ(C, SO) where:
•
•</p>
      <p>C is a category of strategies.</p>
      <p>SO is the strategic objective</p>
      <sec id="sec-4-1">
        <title>For instance, Categ(Business, Reduced Time to Market)</title>
        <p>represents that the strategic objective Reduced  Time  to  Market
belongs to the category of Business strategies.</p>
        <p>
          The original BSC suggests to use a table of four sections, each
containing the strategic objectives that belong to one of the four
major strategic perspectives (Financial, Customer, Internal
Business Process, Learning and Growth) [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
          ]. In case of a software
organization these perspectives can be customized to represent
their own major strategic concerns (such as classifications
proposed in [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6 ref7">6, 7</xref>
          ]). The other form of representing strategic
objectives is to use Strategy Maps which are intended to visualize
how strategic objectives of each category would impact the
objectives of other category [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>
          ]. We propose the use of Strategies
Graph (SG) for representing the Decompositional and
Contributional relations of strategic objectives. The idea of SG
was inspired by goal graph structures in Goal-Oriented
Requirements Engineering, particularly the i* modeling
framework [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>
          ]. The decompositional relations represent the
logical AND/OR decompositions of high-level objectives to those
of lower-levels; and Contributional relations represent the positive
and negative impacts of strategic objectives over each other. . The
contributional relations can be plotted across different categories
(e.g., business, customer, internal process) and levels (high-level
visional strategic to low-level actionable objectives) in the
Strategies Graph. Figure 1 shows a portion of a sample SG.

    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-6">
      <title>Process</title>
      <p>Inspecting the contributions of a new process is intended to
identify the types of impacts that a new process would make on
the strategic objectives of an organization. This is based on the
following assumptions:</p>
      <p>
        The new process is decomposable into a number of method
fragments (as described in [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>
        ]). A method fragment can be
a process or product fragment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every fragment of the new process makes distinguishable
contributions to the strategic objectives of organization.
The overall impact of the new process over the strategic
objectives is the aggregation of contributions of its
fragments over different portions of strategic objectives.
Two approaches are proposed for exploring the contributions of a
method fragment over strategic objectives: Evidence-Based and
Consensus-Based. In the evidence-based approach the
contribution of a method fragment to a strategic objective is
supported by evidential knowledge, which is provided by the
repository of method fragments (introduced in [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
        ]). This
repository provides structured evidential information for a set of
method fragments, mostly agile ones. The content of the
repository has been populated through extensive systematic
literature review of empirical studies, which had reported various
objectives that can be contributed by a method fragment in
different project situations. The content of this repository is
evidential in that it provides references to the original studies
which had reported each contribution. If a strategic objective of
the subject organization is among the objectives dataset of a
candidate method fragment found in the repository, that
information can be used as evidence for exploring the
contribution relation. Otherwise, the contribution relation is
determined through the consensus-based approach, which relies
on an agreement among process analysis team members about the
contribution relation, based on the definition of the method
fragment as understood by the team members. Contribution
relations are defined as the following relation: Cont(MF, SO, R,
T) where:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
      </p>
      <p>A positive contribution implies that the adoption of method
fragment MF would improve the strategic objective SO, and vice
versa for a negative contribution. For instance, Cont(Pair </p>
      <sec id="sec-6-1">
        <title>Programming, Reduced Defect Rate, Two programmers make less </title>
        <p>defect,  ++) implies that the adoption of method fragment Pair 
Programming would improve the strategic objective Reduced 
Defect  Rate, because of the mentioned rationale. As another
example, Cont(Pair  Programming,  Individuals  Productivity,  Less 
LOC  per  Developer  per  Month,  ‐) represents the negative impact
of the method fragment Pair  Programming on strategic objective
Productivity  of  Individuals. (In both examples the contribution
relations have been identified through the evidence-based
approach, with the help of knowledge provided in the repository
of method fragments. This repository is available online at
http://www.ProcessExperience.org)</p>

      <title>3.3 Pre-Adoption Analysis</title>
      <p>After establishing the strategic model of organization and
inspecting the potential impacts of the new process over the
organizational strategic objectives, it is now possible to analyze
the balance of the process adoption initiative. Here, four
techniques are described for the pre-adoption analysis. For each
technique, first the target of the technique is stated, and then the
steps which should be taken.
3.3.1 Balance Improvement
The introduction of a new process to an organization is often
motivated by a set of strategic objectives that are currently not
well met. This can be due to problems of the current development
process, which prevented the organization from achieving its
strategies; or a change in strategies, which made the current
process inadequate of meeting the target values of the new
strategic objectives. To reach a balanced state after adopting the
new process, it is necessary that the new process address the
strategic objectives that are not sufficiently met. Thus the first
target of SBPA is to investigate whether:</p>
      <sec id="sec-7-1">
        <title>The new process is positively contributing to the strategic objectives, which are expected to be improved.</title>
        <p>It should be mentioned that this paper is not concerned with the
problem of finding the strategic objectives that are in need of
improvement. We assume that these objectives are known to the
organization.</p>
        <p>The Balance Improvement analysis is performed through the
following steps:
1.
2.</p>
        <p>Identify the list of strategic objectives whose current status
is not satisfactory and needing improvement – this set of
objectives is called ToBeImprovedObjs.</p>
        <p>Based on the results of (3.2), identify the list of strategic
objectives that will receive, from the fragments of the new
process:</p>
        <p>Only positive contributions – this set is called</p>
        <sec id="sec-7-1-1">
          <title>ToBeImprovingObjs.</title>
          <p>Conflicting contributions (both negative and positive
contributions) – this set is called ToBeConflictingObjs.
Only negative contributions – this set is called</p>
        </sec>

          <p>If ToBeImprovedObjs has any common element with

met. When this situation occurs, the analysis team
should decide on corrective actions on the new process
(e.g. altering the constituent fragments, or changing
the settings of current fragment), depending on the
significance of the strategic objectives in question.
3.3.2 Balance Preservation
The improvement of strategic objectives that were expected to be
improved by the adoption of the new process should not result in
a false perception of overall process improvement. That is
because a new process that is designed to effectively improve a
limited set of objectives can produce uncontrolled negative
impacts on other sets. In SBPA, one of the attributes of an optimal
to-be process is that it does not leave uncontrolled side-effects
over the organizational strategies – especially those which are out
of the focus of improvement. Thus, the second target of SBPA is
to inspect whether:</p>
        </sec>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-7-2">
        <title>The new process is not causing uncontrolled negative impacts on the strategic objectives which are not within the focus of improvement.</title>
        <p>The analysis technique is described in the following steps:
Calculate the contribution weight of every strategic
objective, expressed as CW (SO) – which is the sum of the
value of contribution relations that a strategic objective (SO)
receives from different fragments of the new process. The
value of (qualitative) contribution links is quantified as
follow:
a. +1 for Positive Contribution
b. +2 for Strongly Positive Contribution
c. -1 for Negative Contribution
d. -2 for Strongly Negative
The target is ideally met when the contribution weight of all
strategic objectives is positive. But that is not usually the
case. Thus, for every strategic objective with CW (SO) &lt; 0:
a. If the SO belongs to the ToBeDeterioratingObjs then the
analysis team should go through the following check list
to see whether the perceived deterioration of the SO is
under control:
i. Is it tolerable for the organization to see this
strategic objective deteriorating, in trade-off with
the improvement of other objectives?
ii. Is there any fragment in the new process of
software development that could overcome the
negative contributions, but was overlooked in step
3.2.
iii. Is there any corrective action applicable on the
new process, which would overcome the negative
contributions? If yes, the impacts of this corrective
action on other strategic objectives of organization
should be re-explored by repeating step 3.2.
iv. If all above conditions are denied, the negative
contribution of the new process to the subject

        <p>is

b. If the SO belongs to the ToBeConflictingObjs then the
analysis team should go through a similar check list , but
with the following condition added:
v. Is it worth accepting the negative contribution, in
trade-off with the positive ones towards the same
strategic objective?
3.3.3 Balance Preservation across Categories
The improvement of organizational strategic objectives can be
viewed at different levels. The previous technique was focusing
on instances of strategic objectives, and was concerned with
keeping the balance of each individual objective against others.
However, one of the issues which might disturb the balance of a
process adoption initiative is that the new process worsens one or
more categories of strategic objectives. For instance, for an
organization that is doing badly on customer-related strategic
objectives, the first priority of process improvement would be the
improvement of its customer-related strategies. However, this
should not result in the deterioration of other categories of
strategic objectives such as those for business or internal process.
Thus, the third target of SBPA is introduced at the category level
of organizational strategies, and is intended to inspect whether:</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-7-3">
        <title>The new process is not causing overall deterioration of a particular category of strategic objectives, for the sake of improving some other categories.</title>
        <p>The analysis technique is carried out with the following steps:
1. For each category of objectives, calculate the total weight
of the negative contributions (TWNC) and the total weight
of the positive contributions (TWPC) made towards the
strategic objectives of that category. Calculate the total net
weight of contributions (TWC) for that category TWC =
TWPC – TWNC.
2. A process adoption is considered unbalanced if either of
these conditions hold even in one category of strategic
objectives:
3.3.4 Homogenous Contributions across Categories
The fourth perspective from which the balance of a process
adoption can be viewed is the relative homogeneity of
contributions that the new process makes to different categories of
strategic objectives. This kind of balance analysis is to determine
whether the new process is proportionately treating all categories,
i.e., different categories are benefiting or hurting to the same
degree from the adoption of new process. This can be investigated
by identifying the variance of the percentage of different types of
contributions, made from the new process to different categories
of strategic objectives. Thus, the fourth target of SBPA is to
inspect whether:
1)
2)</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-7-4">
        <title>The new process is causing homogenous impacts over all categories of strategic objectives.</title>
        <p>Analyzing the homogeneity of contributions across different
categories has a precondition. This analysis is meaningful only if
strategic objectives are evenly distributed across different
categories; i.e., the variance of the number of strategic objectives
in different categories does not exceed certain limit. For example,
in an organization with 100 strategic objectives grouped in 3
categories, with distribution of 28 objectives in the first category,
38 in the second, and 34 in the third; it makes sense to analyze the
homogeneity of contributions across categories, because the
variance is not too much and objectives are almost evenly
distributed among categories. But, if the number of objectives
were distributed unevenly, e.g., 80, 15, 5 among three categories,
then due to the high variance of number of objectives across
categories, the homogeneity analysis will not be meaningful. The
reason is that for instance, the last category will be fully
supported by the new process if it receives only five positive
contributions; whereas the first category would need 80 positive
contributions to get the similar status.</p>
        <p>The following technique is proposed for this analysis:
Build the contribution distribution table, which for each
category of strategic objectives shows the number and
percentage (within the category) of strategic objectives
which are:</p>
        <sec id="sec-7-4-1">
          <title>Supported – SO belongs to the ToBeImprovingObjs</title>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec-7-4-2">
          <title>Declined – SO belongs to the ToBeDeterioratingObjs</title>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec-7-4-3">
          <title>Conflicted - SO belongs to the ToBeConflictingObjs</title>
        </sec>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-7-5">
        <title>Unaddressed – Otherwise.</title>
        <p>To investigate the homogeneity of the contributions across
categories, explore the variance of contributions of the new
process to the strategic objectives. This technique would
show whether the new process is making similar
contributions to different categories. To do so, for each status
value (supported, declined, conflicted, unaddressed),
calculate the variances of percentages and numbers in
different categories. For instance, calculate the variance of
the percentage of strategic objectives with the status value of
Supported among different categories. The lower the
variance measures, the more homogenous contributions are
made from the new process to different categories of
objectives.</p>
        <p>The homogeneity of the contributions of a new process to
different categories of strategic objectives becomes important
when the organization expects that improvement in some
categories of strategies will lead to improvements in some other
categories. For example, it is often expected that improvements in
the internal development process will lead to improvements in
achieving business objectives as well as technological ones.
Analyzing the homogeneity of SBPA is a mechanism for
investigating this issue.</p>

      <title>3.4 Post-Adoption Monitoring</title>
      <p>Post-adoption monitoring aims to assess the actual impacts of the
adopted new process on the strategic objectives of the
organization. Unlike pre-adoption analysis, which was based on
evidential or consensual anticipations of the future status of
strategic objectives, post-adoption monitoring is based on data
about the actual status of strategic objectives achievement.
Postadoption monitoring is a necessary action to see whether promises
of the new process are achieved within the current organization
setting, or there is need for further customization of the process or
change of other organizational parameters.</p>
      <p>In order to conduct a post-adoption analysis, strategic objectives
should be supported by quantifiable metrics, with specified target
and threshold values. The target value of a strategic objective
represents its desired status; and the threshold value represents its
worst tolerable status, which might be reached by its
deterioration.</p>
      <p>Post-adoption monitoring involves continuous monitoring of
strategic objectives, comparing current status with what was
analyzed at the pre-adoption analysis. In detail, post-adoption
monitoring aims to assess:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.</p>
      <p>The degree to which the indicators of strategic objectives
which were analyzed to be improved, are actually
improving; and whether this improvement is adequate for
meeting the expected target values.</p>
      <p>The degree to which the indicators of strategic objectives
which were analyzed to be deteriorating, are actually
declining; and whether this deterioration is still tolerable
for the organization.</p>
      <p>The degree to which the indicators of strategic objectives
which were analyzed to receive conflicting contributions
from the new process, are actually changing; whether this
change is positive or negative; and if negative whether it is
tolerable.</p>
      <p>
        To capture the unexpected behaviour of strategic
objectives, e.g., strategic objectives which were analyzed
to remain unaddressed by the adoption of the new process,
but their indicators show improvements or deteriorations.
For either improving or deteriorating strategic objectives,
conducting a root-cause analysis to find the actual causes
of change. If changes were rooted in the fragments of the
new process, then update the repository of method
fragments [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
        ] with the newly investigated evidence.
      </p>
      <p>In cases of deteriorating strategic objectives, if the root
cause was in the new process, inform the process design
team (or other responsible organization members) to fix
the problem, if the deterioration was not tolerable.</p>

      <title>4. INDUSTRIAL EXPERIENCE</title>
      <p>
        The proposed pre-adoption analysis techniques have been
experimented with in an industrial setting. The experiment was
conducted in parallel with an agile adoption initiative in one of
the Ericsson R&amp;D units in Italy. The R&amp;D unit had decided to
gradually adopt some of the fragments of the Scrum process. To
mitigate the risks of process adoption, the new process was going
to be first tried in a pilot project. The unit was going to investigate
the compatibilities and conflicts in the new process by putting it
in a test run, and monitoring the results. The authors of this paper
proposed the strategic balance analysis, as a complement to the
approach that the unit was pursuing. The distinguishing aspect of
the proposed strategic balance analysis approach was that it
investigates the potential impacts of the new process over the
strategic objectives of the organization based on experiments or
experiences from other organizations that are already in the
literature. This empirical evidential knowledge is systematically
provided by the repository of agile method fragments [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
        ].
In this experiment, strategic objectives of the R&amp;D unit were
extracted using a participatory and model-driven approach. The
approach was participatory because representatives of almost all
organization roles (to the level that was related to this initiative)
participated in defining and structuring the strategic objectives.
To facilitate the process of identifying strategic objectives we
took a model-driven approach, in which the Strategies Graph was
used to visualize the strategic concerns of the organization. The
use of the Strategies Graph helped not only in eliciting strategic
objectives, but also in raising the level of shared understanding of
participants about the strategic concerns of various parties in the
organization. A very small portion of the Strategies Graph of this
experiment is shown in the Figure 1. In this experiment,
participants came up with about 50 strategic objectives, classified
into three categories: Business Value, User Orientation, and
Internal Process (categories inspired by Martinsons et al. [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>
        ]).
      </p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-10">
      <title>4.1 Experiment with Pre-Adoption Analysis</title>
      <p>Here we explain the way we experimented with each of the
techniques proposed for pre-adoption balance analysis.
4.1.1 Balance Improvement
In our experiment, the subject organization had a set of
preidentified strategic objectives that were expected to be improved
by the adoption of the new agile process. These objectives were
{Improved  Productivity,  Reduced  Waste,  Better  Time  to  Market, </p>
      <sec id="sec-10-1">
        <title>Improved Communication / Collaboration}.</title>
        <p>What we noticed in the Ericsson experiment was that the strategic
objectives that had been pre-identified for improvement were
mostly high-level objectives, which could have been decomposed
to, or are contributed to, by many finer-grained, more specific
strategic objectives. This issue became apparent when together
with organization members we completed the Strategies Graph.
Questions arose as to which of the high-level strategies were to be
further clarified in terms of their constituent (or contributing)
lower-level objectives. For instance, the strategic objective
‘Reduced  Waste’ was identified to be decomposable into five
other strategic objectives. Having done this, we could identify the
exact middle- and low-level strategic objectives which were
actually in need of improvement. Finally, we identified 23
strategic objectives, at different levels, which were expected to be
improved by the adoption of the new process, resulting in the</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-10-2">
        <title>ToBeImprovedObjs set.</title>
        <p>After inspecting the contributions of the fragments of new process
over the Strategies Graph, the elements of ToBeImprovingObjs,</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-10-3">
        <title>ToBeDeterioratingObjs, and ToBeConflictingObjs were identified.</title>
        <p>In the experiment, the ToBeImprovedObjs had four elements in
common with the ToBeConflictingObjs, but no element in
common with the ToBeDeterioratingObjs. However, the common
set of ToBeImprovedObjs and ToBeConflictingObjs  were
middleand high-level strategic objectives, each was contributed to by a
number of lower-level strategic objectives.</p>
        <p>Another result of this analysis was the following observation: in
most cases the lower-level strategic objectives would belong
either to the ToBeDeterioratingObjs or ToBeImprovingObjs, or
they do not receive any contribution from the new process;
however, middle- and high-level strategic objectives often receive
conflicting contributions from the new process and belong to the
ToBeConflictingObjs (which is quite reasonable because the
received contribution of a high-level objective is the aggregation
of contribution that its lower-level objectives received).
4.1.2 Balance Preservation
Among the strategic objectives that were not in the focus of
improvement, two were identified with CW &lt; 0; one of them
belonged to the ToBeDeterioratingObjs and the other one to the
ToBeConflictingObjs. The deteriorating one was then identified to
be supported by some of the already in-place development
techniques, which were going to remain unchanged after the
adoption of the new process. Thus, the negative impact of new
process to this objective was decided to be tolerable. However,
for the conflicting strategic objective, the trade-off analysis failed
to find any already in-place technique, or any other fragment of
new process to make it up. This issue led the analysis team decide
on a new supportive action, to preserve the balance of that
particular strategic objective.</p>
        <p>It should be mentioned that in this experiment the new process
had only four fragments. These fragments were specifically
chosen by the process design team in order to address some of the
issues of the current process. If the to-be process was more
complex, it could be expected that a greater number of strategic
objectives would have negative CWs. The reason for this
assumption is that at least from the business perspective, the cost
of incorporating a complex set of changes (which radically alters
the current process) is more than the cost of modifying current
process, with a limited set of fragments. Therefore, for complex
process adoption initiatives, strategic objectives which belong to
the Business category are more prone to be side-effects of the
initiative.
4.1.3 Balance Preservation across Categories
In this experiment, after calculating the total weight of positive
and negative contributions (TWPC and TWNC) the total weight
of contribution (TWC) of all categories turned out to be positive.
Indeed, none of the categories received a substantially bad
TWNC, which indicated that the adoption of the new process
would not cause the overall deterioration of one category of
objectives as a side-effect of improving some other categories.
As mentioned before, this experiment was carried out in parallel
with an existing initiative of agile adoption already in progress. In
our observation, this fact might have indirectly influenced the
way stakeholders expressed strategic objectives, predisposing
them towards agile values. For this reason, the candidate method
fragments were mostly analyzed to have positive impacts over
strategic objectives, with few negative impacts. In general, this
issue – i.e., incomplete or biased construction of the Strategies
Graph – can be considered as a threat to the validity of analysis
results.
4.1.4 Homogenous Contributions across Categories
In this experiment, strategic objectives were grouped into three
categories: User Orientation, Business Value, and Internal
Process, respectively containing 16, 15, and 20 strategic
objectives. Figure 2 shows the distribution of the number and
percentage of strategic objectives with different statuses in each
of the three categories. For instance, it shows that 80% (16 out of
20) of the strategic objectives of the Internal Process category
would be supported by the fragments of the new process, with
10% conflicted, 10% unaddressed, and none declined.
The variances of numbers and percentages of different statuses
across categories were then calculated. The results showed that
the new process makes a homogenous contribution to the
Supported strategic objectives across different categories, as the
variances of the percentages and numbers were quite low. The
contributions to Declined strategic objectives also had low
variances.</p>

      <title>4.2 Impacts of SBPA</title>
      <p>The application of SBPA had the following impacts on the
organization in which we conducted the experiment:</p>
      <sec id="sec-11-1">
        <title>The participatory and model-driven approach of</title>
        <p>identifying strategic objectives enabled different parties in
the organization to express their strategic concerns, which
improved the completeness of the SG. Indeed, this process
helped organizational members to gain a shared
understanding of the organizational strategic objectives.
The use of SG for analyzing a set of candidate agile
process fragments introduced a new decision making
approach within the organization, which can be used for
the evaluation of a wide range of organizational initiatives.
The Balance Improvement technique had a considerable
impact on the organization’s decisions about their
candidate agile practices. In fact, through this analysis the
managers discovered that the proposed set of practices are
incomplete with regard to the strategic objectives that
were expected to get improved by the introduction of the
new process.</p>
        <p>The Balance Preservation technique clarified the set of
strategic objectives which might be declined (or
conflicted) by the introduction of new method. This
clarification helped process mangers to know which
strategic objectives would need to be monitored more
closely after adopting the new process.</p>
        <p>
          The category-level analysis techniques of SBPA guided
the decision making of process analysis team by giving
them a wider spectrum of strategic concerns which should
be considered in the process of designing a new process.
In fact, the original idea of introducing a new agile process
to the R&amp;D unit was highly under the influence of the
Lean approach of process improvement, which focuses on
the removal of software process waste [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>
          ]. The
categorylevel analysis techniques raised the importance of other
categories of strategic objectives for the analysis team, and
helped them to keep the integrity of the new process with
respect to its contributions to various categories of
strategic objectives.

      <p>The techniques proposed in this paper can be used to support the
adoption of different kinds of processes. We have focused on the
case of agile adoption, since the repository of method fragments
that we have developed mainly provides information about agile
processes. In this section, we review a number of agile adoption
frameworks, with special focus on the kind analysis methods that
they prescribe for investigating the suitability of a candidate
process for an organization.</p>
      <p>
        Sidky et al. [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>
        ] proposed an agile measurement index for
evaluating the degree to which an organization can become agile.
Based on this index, they defined an agile adoption framework.
The first step seeks to identify discontinuing factors – whose
presence indicates unreadiness of the organization to adopt agile.
Project and organizational capability for adopting agile are then
assessed. Based on the degree of potential agility, the most
suitable set of agile practices are proposed. An application of this
framework in adopting agile processes for the development of
life-critical systems is presented in [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>
        ]. Despite the novelty of
this framework in proposing a set of agile practices with respect
to the potential agility (agile-ability) of an organization, the
framework does not relate agile practices to a balanced
consideration of strategic objectives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Qumer &amp; Henderson-Sellers [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>
        ] proposed an agile adoption
framework backed by an agility measurement technique. The
adoption framework, called Agile Adoption and Improvement
Model (AAIM), introduces six levels of agile adoption: Agile
Infancy, Agile Initial, Agile Realization, Agile Value, Agile
Smart, and Agile Progress. At each level, the AAIM incorporates
certain agile principles (e.g., Speed, Flexibility,
Peopleorientation, Leanness, etc.) into the organization. This framework
uses the 4-DAT agility measurement technique, which provides
specific metrics for quantitatively assessing the agility level of a
software process. Unlike [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>
        ], the AAIM does not explicitly
propose agile practices to an organization,.Rather it focuses on the
localization of agile principles. In relying on a quantitative
measurement scale, the framework is sensitive to the way
individual measures are combined to produce a single measure
to represent the overall agility degree of a process.

      <p>
        Krasteva et al. [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>
        ] proposed an experience-based framework for
adopting agile practices, using techniques from assembly-based
situational process engineering. Sureshchandra et al. [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>
        ]
proposed a framework for adopting agile in distributed
development,composed of four stages: Evaluation, to determine
the degree of distribution of the project; Inception, to form the
distributed teams, and the way agile practice can be incorporated
into the development infrastructure; Transition, to enact the agile
practices into the development activities; and Steady State, to
provide baselines for smoothly adding further distributed teams
into the project.
      </p>
      <p>Our approach in supporting the pre-adoption phase of process
adoption with strategic analysis is quite unique, as none of the
reviewed agile adoption frameworks introduces any technique in
this regard. The proposed techniques can be used in conjunction
with other existing frameworks of agile adoption to further
strengthen the choice of new process from the perspective of its
compliance with the overall strategies of the organization.</p>

      <title>6. DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK</title>
      <p>Adopting a new process is a risky undertaking which should be
carried out with adequate knowledge of its potential benefits and
drawbacks. From the viewpoint of strategic management, process
adoption is a significant organizational initiative, which might
impact a wide range of strategic objectives. Some objectives
might benefit from the adoption of a new process, some might be
hurt. Therefore, it is important for organization managers to first,
know the potential impacts of new process on strategic objectives,
second, know whether the new process is in line with their
strategic plans, and third, know if the new process would make
negative impacts over the already improved strategic objectives.
Having this knowledge about the strategic impacts of a new
process would help managers choose the optimum solution for
their development process, and make informed decisions about its
advantages and drawbacks.</p>
      <p>This paper defined the concept of Strategically Balanced Process
Adoption (SBPA) which aims at a balanced performance across
different categories of strategic objectives while adopting a new
development process. The realization of the SBPA was then
explained in two major parts: pre-adoption analysis and
postadoption monitoring. For the pre-adoption analysis four
techniques were proposed, which anticipate the affects of a new
(candidate) process over the strategic objectives of an
organization, before the new process gets enacted. The idea of
pre-adoption analysis is very similar to the rule of finding bugs in
the process of software development – the earlier a defect is
found, the cheaper it is fix it. Similarly, detecting and fixing the
negative impacts of a development process (over strategic
objectives of an organization) is for sure less expensive at the
time that the new process is not yet adopted than afterwards. Of
course any process initiative comes at a certain cost and might
negatively impact some of the strategic objectives of an
organization. One of the important points in SBPA is its focus on
the analysis of the controllability of negative impacts over
strategic objectives. The negative impacts of an adoption initiative
are controllable if they are supported by reasonable justifications,
or corrective actions to make them up. For instance, the adoption
of an agile process that deploys Pair Programming, as part of its
fragments, might result in the reduction of individuals’
productivity (in terms of LOC per Month per Developer).
However, this negative impact is controllable, if it is justified to
be the reasonable cost of having fewer defects in code.
Although the presented techniques of pre-adoption analysis use
some quantitative computations, the overall approach is not
computational in that the computations are not intended to
produce precise absolute numbers leading to unambiguous
decisions. Instead, these techniques are indicator-oriented, i.e.,
they are used as indicators that provide a kind of dashboard or
decision-aid in order to evaluate the envisaged process change in
a more global perspective.</p>

initiative was inspired by the approach of Balance Scorecards
(BSC) in strategic management of organizations. The BSC argues
that organizations should have a clear definition of their strategic
objectives at different levels of granularity and various categories;
also should have a clear understanding of the impacts of each
organizational initiative over the organizational strategic
objectives; and try to reach a balance state of performance across
different categories of strategic objectives, upon the introduction
of any new organizational initiative.</p>
      <p>
        The proposed techniques for the realization of the SBPA are
based on the repository of method fragments, introduced in our
earlier ICSP paper [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
        ]. This repository was originally built for
agile method fragments, and for each fragment it specifies the list
of objectives which can be contributed by the adoption of that
fragment. The content of this repository is collected through an
extensive literature review of empirical studies. For every
contribution relation that is stated for any agile method fragment,
the repository provides the link to the empirical study which had
reported that contribution.
      </p>
      <p>The reliance of the SBPA on the repository of agile method
fragments has both positive and negative aspects. On the positive
side, it supports the strategic analysis with evidential situations
from the experiences of other organizations in trying similar
fragments in their projects. Therefore, the analysis results are
more reliable, compared to the cases that the basis of analysis is
just the commonly known knowledge of agile processes, or the
experience of a process consultant. Besides, the strategic
knowledge of agile fragments can help organizations in
completing their Strategies Graph. However, relying on the
evidential repository has some negative aspects and imposes some
limitations. The negative aspects are issues such as the lack of
adequate information for some agile method fragments, or the
mismatch of organization situation with the information that is
available in the repository. The primary limitation that can be
imposed by the heavy reliance on this repository is that the
content of repository only supports the strategic analysis of agile
method fragments (and a few non-agile method fragments). Thus
the strategic analysis of non-agile method fragments would be left
based on the consensus of analysis team and description of
process, and not based on firm evidences from the repository.
A final point about SBPA is that the balance of a process adoption
does not mean that the proposed process is the best solution for
the organization. However, the SBPA attributes are quite
important, and can greatly impact the choice of a candidate
development process.</p>
      <p>As future work we are going to propose a complete framework for
strategic software process adoption. This framework would
include techniques for strategic trade-off analysis and strategic
root-cause analysis. The other major future work is the expansion
of the repository of method fragments by supplying information
for further method fragments, and providing more evidences for
its current set of fragments. The proposed techniques of this paper
have been experienced in one industrial case. Further experiments
are intended to be done.</p>
