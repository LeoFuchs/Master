      <abstract>
        <p>Using organization strategic objectives, business goals, and current significant problems to structure and prioritize process improvement programs enlists support from the people most affected by the improvements, as opposed to resistance to “just another initiative.” This is because they see work being done to solve their immediate problems. This approach is implemented using five key questions: MOTIVE - Why change? What are the critical business issues driving process improvement? MODEL - Which reference model best maps to the organization practices? METHOD - How you can quickly and effectively identify improvement opportunities? MANAGING CHANGE - What factors impact the effectiveness of introduced changes? MEASURES - What are critical factors in setting up a measurement program? Or an organization may just have a feeling that things need to improve in order for them to remain competitive. The change model involves an understanding of the present state, a vision of the desired state, and a process for transitioning from the present to the future.</p>

      <p>Change drivers are the catalyst for change.
They push us out of our comfort zone and reveal an
opportunity, need, discomfort, or pain that must be
addressed. They may be problems with the way
things are. Or they may be opportunities that, for
the sake of the organization’sfuture survival, cannot
be ignored. They must be defined, understood, and
provide a compelling business case for the
organization. They must enable organization
members to believe that what they want is more
important than what they already have, and that
upsetting the status quo is preferable to no action.</p>
      <p>The change drivers help an organization
understand and define an organizational response to
the critical question of “Why change?” Typical
change drivers might be declining market share,
reduced profits, increasing personnel turnover, or
new technologies which threaten existing products.</p>

          <title>Strategic Objectives</title>
          <p>Strategic objectives are the critical “market
drivers,” those factors which ultimately determine
organizational success or failure. Business leaders
determine critical business drivers and associated
strategic objectives to answer the question, “What
do we want to achieve as an organization?” Typical
strategic objectives are market sharehime to market,
revenue growthlprofit growth, and company image
as a reliable, cost-effective, value-adding supplier.</p>
          <p>Business purposes focus on activities that the
organization performs to achieve the strategic
objectives. Purposes supporting the strategic
objectives can be derived by addressing operational
issues such as predictability (cost, schedule,
capability, quality), amount of rework, customer
satisfaction, cycle time, and employee
satisfactiodreduced turnover. Department leaders
identify business purposes and goals which support
the strategic objectives. Key questions to ask at this
point are “What do you want the process
improvementprogram to accomplish? How will
you determine if it has been successful?”</p>
          <p>Process goals supportingthe business
purposes can then be derived which address more
precisely defined issues. Example goals are
understanding and controlling customer
requirements, developingrealistic plans,,accurately
tracking progress in order to take corrective action
when there are deviations from plans, collecting
historical data, and minimizing defects in
deliverables. Technical and process leaders
document process goals that support the business
purposes. These are reviewed and approved by the
appropriate business and department leaders.</p>
          <p>Key indicators to help determine whether the
process goals are being accomplished can then be
derived. Typical measures include planned vs.
actual (xxx),defect rate, amount of rework
(quantity or cost), and productivity measurements.
Technical and process leaders determine key
indicators that measure progress against the goals.
These are reviewed and approved by the
appropriate business and department leaders.</p>
          <p>Strategic Objectives I
Profit growth
Market share,
time to market</p>
          <p>Alternatively, or in concert with the top-down
approach, an organization should determine its most
significant problems - where its greatest “pains”
are. This can be done a number of different ways.
Typically, technical leaders and process owners
meet with users to identi@ significant problems
which impact operations and/or business results.
Leaders and users then brainstorm possible
remedies to address the pains. Process owners
identify related process changes based on the
proposed remedies. These proposed changes then
serve as the basis of action plans to address the
identified pains. Pains can also be identified using
one of the reduced-scope assessment methods,
which will be discussed later.</p>

could not be predicted.</p>
          <p>Resources were poorly utilized.</p>
          <p>Testing was inadequate.</p>
          <p>There was a high incidence of software

          <p>Product functionality and quality were
sometimes compromised to meet

          <p>There was no objective basis for judging
product quality.</p>
          <p>The company wanted to address these
problems through a series of initiatives to improve:
product/delivery standards,
time-to-market,
communications,
internal training,
resource utilization.</p>
          <p>Combining a detailed list of “pains” with
organization strategic initiatives enabled the
organization to envision a desired state:</p>

historical performance and are realistic.

      <title>MODEL - Which Reference Model Best</title>
      <sec id="sec-3-1">
        <title>Maps To The Organization Practices?</title>
        <p>There are at least three reasons to use a
reference model in structuring a process
improvement program. A model provides:</p>
        <p>A model can also serve as a source of ideas for
good practices. There are many improvement or
process models available which are intended to
address an organization’s critical issues. Selection
of the most appropriate model to support the
organization’s strategic objectives and business
purpose is important. Two key issues in selecting a
model are its domain and its architecture.</p>
        <sec id="sec-3-1-1">
          <title>Model Domains</title>
          <p>The domain of a model refers to the system
whose order and effectiveness are to be improved.
There are numerous models crafted to focus on the
critical aspects of various domains, including
software, system engineering, system acquisition,
people issues, software integrity, etc. Example
models are the:

Integrated CMM (CMMISM)</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec-3-1-2">
          <title>Model Architecture</title>
          <p>The architecture of a model refers to its
underlying structure and the relationship of maturity
levels and process areas. A staged model (Figure 3)
has specific Process Areas (PA’s) that are
associated with distinct maturity levels. For
example, in the SoftwareCMM, Requirements
Management is a Maturity Level 2 PA, while the
Peer Reviews PA is Level 3. These PA’s are often
referred to as Key Process Areas to emphasize the
fact that the model is not comprehensive, but
focuses on a few critical issues.</p>
          <p>PA1 PA2 PA3 PA4 PA5 PA6</p>
          <p>The Integrated CMM (CMMISMi)s structured
so that its content can be represented in either a
staged or a continuous version.</p>
          <p>The continuous architecture has the advantage
of providing a fairly well defined improvement path
for a specific PA. However, if you have a large
number of process areas, it becomes more difficult
to provide guidance to an organization which is
attemptingto rationally allocate limited
improvement resources across the PA’s. Do you
focus on a few, or try to maintain uniformity of
maturity levels across PA’s, or use some hybrid
approach?This question needs to be answered in
the context of the organization’s business goals and
objectives.</p>
          <p>The advantage of the staged architecture is that
the organizational improvement path is well defined
in terms of which PA’s need attention first.
(However, there may be valid business reasons to
modifLthat recommended path.) The Maturity
Level 2 PA’s focus on getting documented
processes in place at the project level. Maturity
Level 3 provides a framework of standard processes
for leveraging best practices across the
organization. Maturity Levels 4 and 5 focus on
detailed process and product metrics for control and
improvement.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec-3-1-3">
          <title>Choosing a Model</title>
          <p>So how does all the above relate to selecting a
reference model? First of all, you need to define
the domain. What are the critical issues and areas
you want to address? What are the Process Areas
important to that domain? Don’t try to be 100%
correct in your model. If the model addresses
6080% of the organization’s critical issues you’ve
done fairly well.
4.B.2-4</p>
          <p>Next, which model architecture best fits your
objectives? The architecture will probably be pretty
well determined by which model you choose, unless
you are developing a custom model or using the
CMMISMwhich allows you to choose the
architecture. If you need a pretty well defined
roadmap, try to use a model with the staged
architecture. If you’re more interested in seeing
how your processes look across the board, or
focusing on just a few processes, use a model with a
continuous architecture.</p>
          <p>But most importantly, don’t get hung up with
the Levels. Your main goal should be to improve
processes, so select and use a model which maps
well to your critical processes, and use it to help
you determine where your organization may have
some improvement opportunities.</p>

      <sec id="sec-3-3">
        <title>Opportunities?</title>
        <p>After selecting a model it’s necessary to decide
how the organization will assess its conformance to
the model parameters, in order to quickly and
effectively identify improvement opportunities.
There are various assessment methods available,
ranging from less costly techniques such as a
selfassessment, Interim ProfileSMand mini-assessment
to a full-blown CBA-IPI (CMM-Based Appraisal
for Internal Process Improvement), SCESM
(Software Capability Evaluation), or SCAMPISM
(Standard CMMI Assessment Method for Process
Improvement).</p>
        <p>Key issues to consider in choosing an
assessment method are assessment objectives and
desired outputs, accuracy of the results, cost to
prepare for and conduct the assessment, and extent
of organization disruption.</p>

      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-3-4">
        <title>Assessment Objectives</title>
        <p>Any assessment has at least two objectives:
Gather accurate data in an efficient,
minimally disruptive way.</p>
        <p>Help to identify and prioritize
improvement opportunities.</p>
        <p>These objectives can be achieved in a number
4.B.2-5
of different ways, with varying degrees of cost and
accuracy. Sometimes a third objective is
appropriate:</p>
        <p>Signal to the organization that a new way
of life is beginning.</p>
        <p>This third objective is particularly applicable
when the organization wants to institute a change in
its culture, its customary way of doing things. In
this case disruption is good.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-3-5">
        <title>Assessment Outputs</title>
        <p>Most assessments have two major categories
of outputs: findings and recommendations.</p>

        <p>Sustain sponsorship and establish

        <p>Facilitate continued process improvement.</p>
        <sec id="sec-3-7-1">
          <title>Assessment Methods</title>
          <p>A CMM self-assessment is used to educate
the organization on the model and to begin to
identify areas for improvement. The procedure can
be administered in about one-half day and provides
scores by Process Area Goal, based on the
understanding of the participants involved. It is
based on a detailed survey that is administered by
the deploying organization. Accuracy tends to be
low. As the organization becomes more familiar
with the CMM@and undergoes more intensive
assessments, accuracy generally increases. Cost
and organization disruption are fairly low.</p>
          <p>A Mentored Self-Assessment (MSA) requires
a trained and experienced MSA Leader from
outside the organization. He provides CMM
training and administers a CMM Self-Assessment
in a group setting with selected organization
members. The purpose of the mentored
selfassessment is to ensure that an organization
understands the meaning and intent of the CMM,
and to provide an independent validation of the
selfassessment results. Accuracy tends to be fair, with
the cost and organization disruption being low.</p>
          <p>Interim ProfileSMis a Maturity Questionnaire
(MQ) based technique [13. After initial logistics and
setup, the MQ is administered to a majority of
project/organization members. The data are
collected, analyzed, and summarized into a set of
initial project profiles which are reviewed by
project members. An organization profile is then
created and distributed, and feedback on the process
obtained. An Interim Profile is used to check the
status of progress improvement efforts between
assessments. It is not recommended as an initial
assessment. Accuracy, cost and disruption are
similar to an MSA.</p>
          <p>A CMM mini-assessment is a reduced-scale
modification of the CBA-IPI where two (or more)
trained and experienced assessors from outside the
organization review the documented processes and
implementation evidence and conduct several group
interviews. The purpose of the mini-assessment is
to provide an independent verification of self
assessment results and to provide suggestions for
improvements based on an independent review.
Accuracy is fairly good for mini-assessments. Cost
of assessment preparation and conduct and
organization disruption are moderate.</p>
        </sec>

      <sec id="sec-3-8">
        <title>A CMM Based Appraisal for Internal</title>
        <p>Process Improvement (CBA-IPQSMis conducted
according to an SEI-defined process [2]. Because of
the considerable cost associated with formal
assessments, they must be scheduled to provide
maximum benefit to the organization. The normal
output of a CBA-IPI is a findings briefing which
includes KPA strengths and weaknesses, and
GoaVKPAMaturity Level satisfaction. Accuracy is
generally good; preparation and conduct cost and
organization disruption tend to be fairly high. The
disruption can work to the organization’s advantage
by communicating that this is a significant event in
the life of the organization, and the start of a new
way of doing business.</p>
        <p>A Software Capability Evaluation (SCE)SM
is similar to a CBA-IPI, except that all the team
members come from outside the organization being
evaluated [3]. A SCE typically costs about the
same as a CBA-IPI of similar scope. It is often
used by government agencies or other entities
desiring to assess the risk of using some
organization to develop software.</p>
        <p>SCAMPISM(Standard CMMISMAssessment
Method for Process Improvement) is a part of the
Integrated CMM Product Suite [4]. The method
helps an organization gain insight into its process
capability or organizational maturity by identifying
strengths and weaknesses of its current processes
relative to one or more of the CMMI models,
including the Integrated Capability Maturity Model
for Systems Engineering and Software Engineering
(CMMI-SE/SW)</p>
        <sec id="sec-3-8-1">
          <title>Assessment Considerations</title>
          <p>There are at least three major factors to
consider in choosing an assessment method:
Accuracy of the assessment - How well
will the assessment method identify
improvement opportunities? Are there
major opportunities it might miss?
-Cost - This includes both preparation
costs, including team selection, training
and preparation, if any, and organization
preparation, and the costs of actually
conducting the assessment.</p>
          <p>Organization disruption - How much will
the assessment impact normal
organization operations, and can this
impact be used to communicate important
issues to the organization?</p>
          <p>Table 3 provides a summary comparison of
the accuracy, cost and organization disruption of
various assessment methods.

          <p>Conversely, Hefner [ 6 ] identifies the top ten
reasons process improvement programs fail:
Failures in strafegy:</p>
          <p>Failing to define reasonable goals and
plans?
Failing to tie the improvement goals to
business objectives.</p>
          <p>Having inadequate resources and
unrealistic expectations.</p>
          <p>Failures in planning:</p>
          <p>Starting improvement efforts without an
assessment (andor without CMM
knowledge).</p>
          <p>Running improvement efforts like another
Level 1 project, with no requirements, no
plan, no tracking against plan, no
configuration management, no quality
assurance, etc.</p>
          <p>Over-focussing on a common solution
“Let’s write a new standard development
process.”
Failures in execution:</p>
          <p>Ignoring middle management - Middle
managers stand to lose the most, and are
the most effective in resisting change.</p>
          <p>Confusing institutionalization with
standardization - A strong culture does not
imply everybody does it the same way.</p>
          <p>Defining process changes too early
Improvement is not simply about doing
things differently; it requires a change in
the culture to sustain the improvements.</p>
          <p>Trying a do-it-yourself approach - SEPG
skills are different than software
development and management skills.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec-3-10-2">
          <title>Cultural Issues</title>
          <p>The organization culture has a major (perhaps
over-riding) impact on the success of a process
improvement program. What is culture? It is a
pattern of shared basic assumptions [7]:
that a group learned as it solved problems,
that has worked well enough to be
considered valid, and
is reinforced as the correct way to
perceive, think, and feel in relation to
resolving problems.</p>
          <p>Humphrey suggests that many current software
problems stem from the pervasive culture of
software organizations [SI.This culture has
developed over many years and has been largely
responsible for the poor performance of these
organizations. This “hacker” culture glorifies rapid
coding, is schedule driven, and objects to planning.
Commitments are generally missed, while quality is
unmeasured and unmanaged.</p>
          <p>
            Organization culture has three layers:
communications (the visible aspects), expectations
(the desired results), and assumptions (the
subconscious aspects) [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">9</xref>
            ].Cultural change involves
rethinking those basic assumptions, deciding some
assumptions are no longer valid, and learning a new
pattern of shared basic assumptions.
          </p>
          <p>To achieve success, one must focus attention
on the visible aspects of process improvement. But
it is also necessary to pay attention to the invisible
aspects of culture change. Start with understanding
the assumptions, and improve by changing
expectations and communication. Keep yourself
and others motivated to change.</p>
          <p>In order to achieve successful change, the
existing culture must be recognized and dealt with.
Existing culture tends to reinforce itself. For a
change to stick, expectations must be:
expressed - “Here’s what we expect.”
demonstrated - “Here’s what we do.”
reinforced - “Here’s what we reward.”
believed - “Here’s why this works for us.”
Cultural change, enhanced by a transformed
leadership and appropriate tools and enablers, will
enhance the formal process change process. Absent
that foundation, portrayed in Figure 5 , the formal
process change is likely to flounder.

          <p>Transition strategies are used to facilitate the
introduction of process changes. They address eight
key organizational issues and possible points of
resistance to be dealt with throughout the entire
change process [lo].</p>
          <p>Team structure - Establish the team and
its structure to plan, implement and
sustain the change: sponsor, leadership
team, change team, change coach, and
transition team.</p>
          <p>Leadership - Establish the sponsorship
development activity and learning
organization environment for achieving
and sustaining the desired change.</p>
          <p>Education and training - Establish the
education and training to provide
stakeholders the knowledge and skills of
methods, tools and processes integral to
the change initiative.</p>
          <p>Measures - Establish the business value,
process, and readiness measures that
should be tracked and monitored to enable
learning and measure progress, as well as
results. (See Measures section of
Guidebook.)
Business and technolow integration
Determine the desired changes in business
performance and integrate the
technologydriven changes that will support it, such as
systems life cycle, project management, or
new tools.</p>
          <p>Performance management - Identify the
desired behaviors and performance results
for the change; establish the reinforcement
mechanisms for each behavior (positive
and negative) to institutionalize the
change.</p>
          <p>Relationship management - Determine
how the change will impact your customer
or supplier and establish a win-win
business relationship for working
together.</p>
          <p>Communications - Establish
communications for the change within all
levels of the organization.</p>

          <p>Develop a Shared Understanding
Describe the change, build the team
structure, assess the organization’s
readiness, and complete project startup
Develop Kev Strategies - Determine

structure and process, and prepare a
phased implementation with the enabling
strategies, processes, and associated
training
Align the Organization - Apply the

          <title>Process Improvement</title>
          <p>Sponsorship, is, of course, one of the most
critical elements in successful process
improvement. Without serious top management
involvement and support long term successful
process improvement is doomed. Senior
management understanding is the first critical
element in a series of steps towards successful
process improvement, including senior management
commitment, organization assessment, process
documentation, improvement implementation, and a
focus on project management discipline [121.</p>
          <p>Change agents are those individuals who
serve as catalysts to bring about organization
change. They should be respected opinion leaders
who can influence others to implement change.
Some basic principles for change agents include:
get a sponsor with appropriate budget and spending
authority; do “real work;” be a missionary; rather
than tackle an entire process area, do one thing
better, faster, cheaper than people did it before;
advertise, advertise, advertise - make certain that
every victory makes the evening news [131.</p>
          <p>The Software Engineering Process Group,
as the focal point for process improvement,
provides guidance and leadership to the
organization [14, 151. Composed of line
practitioners who have varied skills, the group is at
the center of the collaborative effort of everyone in
the organization who is involved with software
engineering process improvement. Group size is
usually equal to 1-3% of the development staff.
Because the process group is generally small, it
relies upon support of the support of a management
steering committee and various technical working
groups to address specific process issues.</p>
        </sec>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-3-11">
        <title>Process Action Teams (PAT’S)are a good</title>
        <p>choice for actually defining and implementing
specific process improvements [161. Getting PAT’S
up to speed quickly is easier with a defined process.
One such process is documented in ETVX (Entry,
Task, Verification, exit) format, which is also used
by the team to document the model of the process
they are working on. In addition to assorted
templates and guidelines for both project outputs
and for project planning and status reporting, each
step in the process has entry and exit criteria, roles,
measures, standards and tools [171.</p>

          <title>Measurement Basics</title>
          <p>The final step in process improvement (and the
first step in the next cycle) is to determine the
impact on the organization of the changes that have
been implemented. This implies some set of
measures which can be compared against a baseline
in order to determine quantitatively how successful
the process improvement program has been. To be
4.B.2-9
effective, software measurement should be
integrated with an overall strategy for software
process improvement.</p>
          <p>There are three questions to consider in setting
up a measurement program:
0
0
0
0
0
0</p>
          <p>Are the measures relevant?</p>
          <p>How will you know if your critical
parameters have improved?
How do those measures relate to the Key
Process Areas?
Will moving up maturity levels achieve
improved effectiveness?
Are the measures significant?</p>
          <p>Is the CMM maturity level consistent with
measured improvements in business and
quality?
Does the organization prepare with rigor
for an assessment but afterwards give less
than that effort to sustain and improve?
The appearance of process maturity is not
a substitute for having process maturity
there’s more to the CMM than an
assessment!
Are the measures objective?
“Think of the organizational measurement
system as the dials and indicators in an
airplane cockpit. For the complex task of
navigating and flying an airplane, pilots
need detailed information about many
aspects of the flight: fuel, air speed,
altitude, bearing, destination and other
indicators that summarize the current and
predicted environment.”[ 181
“Now consider what this analogy would
be like if it included a multitude of tiny
gremlins controlling wing flaps, fuel flow,
and so on of a plane being buffeted by
winds and generally struggling against
nature, but with the gremlins always
controlling information flow back into the
cockpit instruments, for fear that the pilot
might find gremlin replacements.”[ 191</p>
          <p>Answering these three questions can help
organizations select the most appropriate measures
and set up a measurement program to guide the
implementation of the process improvement
program. Capers Jones suggests that the best way
to decide what to measure is to find out what
industry leaders measure, and then measure the
same things [20]. He recommends a large number
of metrics in three categories: Quality Measures,
Productivity and Schedule Measures, and Business
and Corporate Measures.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, lower maturity
organizations should not try to do too much. A few
metrics should be selected which will be useful for
project management and applied them across the
board. As experience and confidence are gained,
more metrics can be added. Those which don’t add
significant value should be removed. For example,
if the business goals are based on functionality,
cost, time to market, and quality, project and
process issues that relate to achieving those goals
should be identified. Process performance can then
be quantified by measuring attributes of products
produced by the processes as well as by measuring
process attributes directly [213.</p>

          <title>The Goal-Question-Measures (GQM</title>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec-3-12-3">
          <title>Approach</title>
          <p>The Goal-Question-Measures approach is very
useful in determining what measures to collect. In
goal-driven measurement, the primary question is
not “What metrics should I use?” but “What do I
want to know or learn?” Because the answers
depend on the organization’s goals, no fixed set of
measures is universally appropriate. The
goaldriven measurement process is based on three
precepts:</p>
          <p>Measurement goals are derived from
business goals. The goal-driven process
begins with identifying business goals and
breaking them down into manageable
subgoals.</p>
          <p>The primary mechanisms for translating
goals into issues, questions, and measures
are the mental models that you have for
the processes you use. These mental
models gain substance and evolve as you
begin to make them explicit. They are the
engines that generate the insights that
guide you to useful measures and actions.
GQM translates informal goals into
executable measurement structures. The
4.B.2-10
process ends with a plan for implementing
well-defined measures and indicators that
support the goals. Along the way, it
maintains traceability back to the goals, so
that those who collect and process
measurement data do not lose sight of the
objectives.</p>

Software Measurement - A Guidebook” [22]</p>

          <title>Measurement Dangers</title>
          <p>There are two main uses of measurements:
information and motivation [19]. Each use has a set
of problems associated with it. Further, mixing the
two uses can have negative effects. Additionally,
informational measures can be intentionally or
inadvertently subverted into motivational measures.</p>
          <p>Informational measures are used to provide
process/product insight and a basis for
decisionmaking. They should not affect behavior.</p>
          <p>Informational measures have two kinds of problems
[19]:</p>
          <p>Unclear meaning. Numbers may not be
clearly understood, due to not realizing
the implicit model between the numbers
and the reality [24]; e.g., what is the
meaning in the real world of the Technical
Complexity Factor in the Function Point
Method? How does this impact project
effort?
Inauuropriate operations. Not all numbers
can be meaningfully averaged or
otherwise combined or manipulated; e.g.,
a 2000 LOC program probably will take
something other than twice as along as a
1000 LOC program to complete.</p>
          <p>Motivational measures are used to promote
greater effort in pursuit of organizational goals.
They should affect behavior. The main problem
with motivational measures is that they can become
dvsfunctional; i.e., they can motivate undesired
behaviors. “Dysfunction occurs when the validity of
information ... is compromised by the unintended
reactions of those being measured.” “The major
problem for most incentive systems is ... bias
intentionally introduced by those being measured.”
~ 9 1</p>
          <p>Some examples of dysfunctional measures are:
Standardized tests (coaching and
preparation skews results)
Production targets (“storming” ignores
quality and equipment maintenance)
Sales commissions (overselling, not
providing value to the customer)
Stock value (quick cuts, short-term
changes)
“Kills” (Vietnam deaths
ncouragedhnflated)
Piecemeal pay (can lead to quality
problems)
Planned vs. actual (re-baselined cost,
schedule)
Defects (overhnderstated, misdiagnosed)
Maturity levels (do processes add business
value?)

          <p>I S 0 9000 certification (more than just
documented standards?)</p>
          <p>Possible dysfunction in the measurement
program should be considered and dealt withxp
front, in the planning stage. Some ways to prevent
dysfunction include [251:</p>
          <p>Don’t have the measures take the place of
the underlying goals.</p>
          <p>Workers should be internally motivated;
measurement should provide them with
self-assessment information.</p>
          <p>Reinforce, don’t enforce, human behavior.
Watch out for opportunistic behaviors.</p>
          <p>Set solid objectives and plans.</p>
          <p>Make measurement part of the process.</p>
          <p>Understand benefits and limitations.</p>
          <p>Focus on cultural issues.</p>
          <p>Create a safe environment for collecting
and reporting data.</p>
          <p>Be ready to change.</p>
          <p>Have a complementary suite of measures.
Conclusion</p>
          <p>Any process improvement program should be
driven by and related to some set of business or
over-arching organizational needs. By considering
change drivers in concert with the organization
strategic objectives and “pains” one can develop a
vision of the desired state, what the organization
should look like and how it should behave after the
desired changes are achieved. An appropriate
reference model is then chosen and used in an
assessment to identify improvement opportunities.
Based on the assessment findings an action plan is
developed and implemented which addresses both
specific process changes and organization cultural
issues. Finally, an appropriate set of measures is
defined and implemented to help measure the
effects of the various changes.</p>
