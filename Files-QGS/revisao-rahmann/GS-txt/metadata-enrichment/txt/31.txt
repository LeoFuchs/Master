End-to-End Automation in Cloud Infrastructure Provisioning. Infrastructure provisioning in the Cloud can be time-consuming and error-prone due to the manual process of building scripts. Configuration Management Tools (CMT) such as Ansible, Puppet or Chef use scripts to orchestrate the infrastructure provisioning and its configuration in the Cloud. Although CMTs have a high level of automation in the infrastructure provisioning, it still remains a challenge to automate an iterative development process based on models for infrastructure provisioning in the Cloud. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a process whereby the infrastructure is automatically built, managed, and provisioned by using scripts. However, there are several infrastructure provisioning tools and scripting languages that need to be used coherently. In previous work, we have introduced the ARGON modelling tool with the purpose of abstracting the complexity of working with different DevOps tools through a domain specific language. In this work, we present an end-to-end automation for a toolchain for infrastructure provisioning in the Cloud based on DevOps community tools and ARGON.
