DevOpSlang â€“ Bridging the Gap between Development and Operations. DevOps is an emerging paradigm to eliminate the split and barrier between developers and operations personnel that traditionally exists in many enterprises today. The main promise of DevOps is to enable continuous delivery of software in order to enable fast and frequentreleases. This enables quick responses to changing requirements of customers and thus may be a critical competitive advantage. In this work we propose a language called DevOpSlang in conjunction with a methodology to implement DevOps as an efficient means for collaboration and automation purposes. Efficient collaboration and automation are the key enablers to implement continuous delivery and thus to react to changing customer requirements quickly.
