Does Your Configuration Code Smell?

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the practice of specifying computing system configurations through code, and managing them through traditional software engineering methods. The wide adoption of configuration management and increasing size and complexity of the associated code, prompt for assessing, maintaining, and improving the configuration codes quality. In this context, traditional software engineering knowledge and best practices associated with code quality management can be leveraged to assess and manage configuration code quality. We propose a catalog of 13 implementation and 11 design configuration smells, where each smell violates recommended best practices for configuration code. We analyzed 4,621 Puppet repositories containing 8,9 million lines of code and detected the cataloged implementation and design configuration smells. Our analysis reveals that the design configuration smells show 9% higher average co-occurrence among themselves than the implementation configuration smells. We also observed that configuration smells belonging to a smell category tend to co-occur with configuration smells belonging to another smell category when correlation is computed by volume of identified smells. Finally, design configuration smell density shows negative correlation whereas implementation configuration smell density exhibits no correlation with the size of a configuration management system.
