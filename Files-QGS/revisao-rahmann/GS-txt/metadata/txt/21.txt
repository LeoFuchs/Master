SENDIM for Incremental Development of Cloud Networks: Simulation, Emulation & Deployment Integration Middleware

Cloud networks are tested over simulation, emulation, and physical environments at different stages of development. Configuration management tools manage deployments and migrations across different cloud platforms, mitigating tedious system administration efforts. However, currently a cloud networking simulation cannot be migrated into an emulation, or vice versa, without rewriting and manually re-deploying the simulated application. This paper presents SENDIM 1 , a Simulation, Emulation, aNd Deployment Integration Middleware for cloud networks. As an orchestration platform for incrementally building Software-Defined Cloud Networks (SDCN), SENDIM manages the development and deployment of algorithms and architectures the entire length from visualization, simulation, emulation, to physical deployments.
