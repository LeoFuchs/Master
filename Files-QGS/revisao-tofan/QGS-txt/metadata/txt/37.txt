Diagrammatic Modeling of Architectural Decisions

The paper presents a semi formal model of architectural decisions referred to as Maps of Architectural Decisions (MAD). In a form of a diagram they represent the most important components of architectural decisions (concerns, possible choices, constraints etc.) as well as logic of architectural decision making, i.e. dependencies between architectural decisions. This increases the level of formalism of the architectural decisions documentation, improves its readability and makes architec- tural knowledge gathered during the decision making process easier to comprehend, share and maintain.
