Guiding Architectural Decisions with the Influencing Factors Method

The Influencing Factors (IF) method guides the architect through stakeholdersâ€™ concerns to architectural decisions in line with current business goals. The result is a set of requirements on software quality attributes and business goals and highlighted trade-offs among software quality attributes and among business goals. The IF method is suitable for sustainable software systems since it allows new concerns, resulting from changes in business goals, stakeholder concerns, technical environment and organization, to be added to existing concerns.
