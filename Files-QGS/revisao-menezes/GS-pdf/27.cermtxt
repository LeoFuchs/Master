Abstract
Enterprises make great efforts to adopt up-to-the-minute technologies and completely new systems. Despite these efforts,
software projects outcomes are not successful. Indeed, poor risk management of software projects often leads to failure,
which can impact the project outcomes. For this reason, practitioners should follow a risks strategy that drives their
software project toward success. To address this need, this paper presents a risks checklist of software projects. This
gathers together the risks affecting the performance of software projects. Moreover, the authors use the importanceperformance
approach to assess the risks factors identified. The findings allowed us to define the most suitable strategy for
managing each risk in more effective way.

1. Introduction
Cristina López and Jose L. Salmeron / Procedia Technology 5 (2012) 437 - 444
In recent decades, companies across the world have adopted enterprise information systems by means of
IS/IT (Information Systems/Information Technologies) projects. These applications allow the modeling and
automation of firms' activities, providing relevant information for decision making. However, success of
enterprise information systems adoption is never guaranteed. The outcomes obtained in IS/IT projects
determinates it.
However, as is indicated in [1], the nature of IS/IT projects creates many risks that must be managed
diligently. A study carried out by Standish Group International consultancy shows that only 32% of the IS/IT
projects in 2009 can be considered successful [2]. This means that they finished on time, within budget and
the final result satisfied the needed requirements [3].
To avoid unexpected results, the professionals have to manage their risks effectively and efficiently [4, 5].
This means they have to identify, evaluate and plan the actions to be undertaken, and continuously monitor the
risks of their projects [6]. In fact, during the last few years, the IS/IT projects successful ratio has been
improved [7], but this continue being low.
IS/IT projects risks research is not scarce in the literature. In order to support project managers' activity,
several studies have proposed tools and methods for assessing risks in this kind of projects [8]. However,
frequently, practitioners have difficulties to understand the use of these tools. In contrast, we have not
identified research, which state the most effective strategies for managing IS/IT project risks.
According to this, our aim is to study IS/IT project risks. To do this, we have used an ImportancePerformance
approach. Prior to that, we have identified the risk that threatens IS/IT projects. Subsequently, we
have applied the importance-performance analysis (IPA) technique. This allows to assess the risks from two
dimensions: probability of occurrence and negative impact on the IS/IT projects outcomes [9]. The results
indicate practitioners, what response strategy must select for managing each risks in more effective way.
2. Risk management in IS/IT projects
An IS/IT project is a large-scale, unstructured and highly complex undertaking. In some cases, this even
requires the use of unfamiliar technologies and tools. Hence many controllable and uncontrollable risks can
affect its outcome [10].
A risk is an event characterized by uncertainty because it may or may not occur. If this risk turns into a real
problem, this may impact the project success. Hence, to avoid undesired outcomes, practitioners have to
continuously manage in a proactive way the risks existing in their IS/IT projects [11]. The most used criteria
to determine the importance of factors is the risk of exposure [8].
Risk management shows us the real situation in which our project is, being able to manage the threats in a
proactive way. If the project team identifies, assesses, treats and monitors existing risks in such projects, the
probability of failure decreases. Hence, it has given rise to a proliferation of studies about software projects
risks. But research in the literature focus on the identification and assessment phases established in risks
management methodologies [6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17].
More specifically, in last years, evaluation models based on grey correlation [18], probabilistic terms [19],
fuzzy theory [20, 21], bayesian networks [22] have been developed to assess software project risks. Other
studies identify and prioritize the existing risk factors in IT/IS projects from more to less problematic [23, 24].
Even, a risk management application has also been created for the modeling, optimal adaptation and
implementation of an enterprise system [25]. In contrast, scarce studies evaluate and identify the most
effective strategies for managing IS/IT project risks.

From an IS/IT project begins, practitioners should follow specific strategies in order to effectively manage
existing risks [26]. Despite, studies about strategies to deal with IT/IS projects risks is scarce in the literature.
One study states mitigations strategies for mitigating risks from economic perspective [27]. However, other
factors like the importance of risks also should be considered in this issue. In fact, information about the
probability of occurrence and impact of risks on IS/IT project can support the practitioner to select a better
risk management strategy [28].
Actually, the selection of the risks strategy followed depends on the manager's subjective judgments. To
support the project managers' work, we have realized a formal study about risks which impact the IS/IT
projects success. To do this, we have used an IPA approach. In this way, we identified the risk that affects
IS/IT projects development. Subsequently, experts assessed the importance of each risk identified. The
findings allowed us constructing an IP matrix. This indicate practitioners which strategy should follow to deal
with each IT/IS projects risks in more effective way.
3. Research method
The main purpose of this study is to state the most effective response strategy for managing each IS/IT
project risk. With this in mind, firstly, we identified the risks that affect the development of IS/IT projects. To
do this, we carried out a critical literature review of software risk management. The risks identified were
checked removing duplicates eliminating those factors which do not affect IS/IT projects.
In order to validate the factors identified, we consulted 12 experts in IS/IT projects. The optimal number of
experts depends on the characteristics of the study itself. We can, however, say that the greater the
heterogeneity of the group, the fewer is the number of experts recommended, 12 being a good size [29, 30].
All experts' opinions were considered to be of the same importance. Respondents were not chosen just
because they were easily accessible. Thus, we obtained the list of IS/IT projects risks.
Later, we evaluated the risks identified using the IPA method. This technique was introduced by [31] to
selecting marketing strategies. IPA has also been applied in such different fields as tourism [32], banking [33],
quality of service [34], e-Business [35], and education [36], among others. Its wide acceptance can be
explained by its ease of application, simplicity and utility [34].
IPA combines measures of importance of each factor (i.e., a risk) and its performance into a twodimensional
grid or matrix. In our study, performance dimension refers to the risks' impact on the
development of IS/IT projects, meanwhile importance refers to the probability of occurrence of each factor.
In order to estimate the probability of occurrence and impact of each risk, we again consulted the abovementioned
experts. In this way, we sent a survey to the participants via email. Both probability of occurrence
and impact dimensions were measured on a 5-point likert scale, as is suggested in [31]. Basing on the replies
received, we calculated the mean and the standard deviation for each risk, in each dimension [31, 35]. Finally,
we plotted each risk according its level of importance (mean value) and probability (mean value), on the IP
grid. Each quadrant refers to a different group of risks. Hence, practitioners have to follow different strategies
for managing each group (quadrant) in more effective way. In the next section, we present the results obtained
in this study.
4. Findings
The goals in our research were to analyze existing risks in IS/IT projects and identify the most effective
strategies for treating those. In this way, 12 experts in this kind of projects activate participated in our study.
They started checked the risks identified in a critical literature review. The result was the checklist of IS/IT
project risks depicted in Table 1.

Subsequently, we assessed the risks identified in the checklist using the IPA approach. In this way, experts
individually estimate the probability and impact of each factor. Table 2 shows the impact and probability of

Impact and probability ratings determine the coordinates for each risk on the map and thus determine their
placements. Specifically, the ratings were used to split the axes. We thus carried out the four-quadrant matrix
showed in Fig. 1. The quadrant, in which a risk is placed, determines the most effective strategy to treating it.
So, the IP map yields the following strategic suggestions for managing risks in IT/IS projects:
• Quadrant 1 (high impact, high probability). These risks are the most critical. In fact, experts considered
that those strongly impact on project development. In addition, participant revealed that the probability of
occurrence of these risks is high. Indeed, practitioners should follow the strategy "elimination of root442
Cristina López and Jose L. Salmeron / Procedia Technology 5 (2012) 437 - 444
cause" [18]. That is, they should identify and eliminate those elements, which can provoke its appearance
in the IS/IT project.
• Quadrant 2 (high impact, low probability). These risks do not usually appear in IS/IT projects. However,
when they convert into a real project problem, factors impact strongly on IS/IT projects development. In
order to manage them, practitioners should follow a prevention strategy [18]. This consists in defining and
applying a plan to control the occurrence of these risks in the project.
• Quadrant 3 (low impact, low probability). These risks do not usually appear in IS/IT projects, as well as
slightly impact on IS/IT project development. Therefore, in order to manage them, practitioners should
follow a fix each error strategy [18]. This consists in treating risks when they convert into real problems.
• Quadrant 4 (low impact, high probability). These risks usually appear in IS/IT projects, although normally,
they slightly affect IS/IT projects development. Therefore, in order to manage them, practitioners should
follow a mitigation strategy [18]. This consists in estimating the time required to minimize these risks, if
they would become real project problems.

5. Conclusions
A successful management of IS/IT projects requires practitioners to follow effective strategies for
managing risks. The focus of IS/IT project management studies is the risk assessment. This is explained why
information about the importance of project risks supports the practitioners to select a better risk management
strategy. With this in mind, this paper proposes the use of IP approach to select the most suitable risks
response strategy in IS/IT projects. In this way, we carried out a checklist of risks. Later, the factors identified
were evaluated according to the definition of risk exposure, and placed in an IP matrix. The findings allow us
to identify the most suitable strategy for managing each risk in a more effective way.
