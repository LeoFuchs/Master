Abstract: Software Services Outsourcing (SSO) industry has grown rapidly in
the last few decades in undertaking software projects. Projects are grouped
with several other projects according to some similarity, for example same
customer, same domain, same geography, or some other factor(s). When
an SSO enterprise undertakes concurrent execution of multiple projects
characterised by size, complexity, resource requirements, etc. in multiple
locations, it is necessary to estimate 'generic risk factors'. Although generic
risk factors are used in medical/actuarial science, so far they have not been
applied in SSO industry and therefore have not been mandated in the existing
IT-related standards; which currently focus on project-specific risk factors. In
this paper, we demonstrate the use of generic risk factors by developing a
computational and workflow system framework. Such a framework may be
used to upgrade existing international standards on project risk management.

Introduction
IT services can be obtained from in-house IT departments, or from a vendor. Procuring
IT services from vendors is termed outsourcing. Software Services Outsourcing (SSO) is
a common practice any where in the world (Kakumanu and Portanova, 2006). By the
beginning of this century, over three quarters of large firms were engaged in long-term
SSO contracts. Primary drivers for outsourcing are desire to reduce costs or increase
profitability, desire to focus on core competency, access to special expertise, speeded up
delivery, relieving resource constraints and many others (Davies, 2004). Estimates vary
but most agree that the global outsourcing market is pegged upwards of a trillion US
dollars. According to one study, 57% of this market was serviced by the USA, 4% by
India, 3% by China, Philippines and SE Asia, and 36% by other countries (Brown and
Wilson, 2007). Another study concluded that the worldwide IT services spending
aggregated nearly USD 1.7 trillion, and computed a growth of 7.3% over the previous
year. Two major components of this market were found to be:
•
•
Software Services Outsourcing: Software and other services including Business
Process Outsourcing (BPO) at USD 1.2 trillion - over 71% of the total spend in
2007.
Hardware spends, at USD 478 billion, accounted for over 28% of the total
worldwide IT services spending in 2007 (NASSCOM, 2008).
In this paper, we first review the globally recognised standards that are in use in SSO
industry, as well as the existing literature on project risk management. We then introduce
the concept of project-specific and generic software project risk factors. To understand
the concept of generic risk factors, we cite two research studies. Koong et al. (2008)
analysed occurrences of internet fraud in the USA between 2002 and 2006, and found
that there were correlations between factors such as places with more people, more
transactions, digital divide and specific regions with the trend in internet frauds. Kasiri
and Sharda (2008) demonstrated that time wasted through frequent e-mail checking and
response is dependent upon generic 'job context' factors such as incoming e-mail
frequency, interruption cost and time available to spend on e-mails. Koong et al. (2008)
had recommended that these generic factors can be used by services and standards
experts and enforcement agencies. Generic software project risk factors can also be
similarly used by services and standards experts, and SSO management.
Estimating operational risk indices
45
Unlike project-specific risk factor based indices, generic risk indices can be
aggregated to give higher levels of grouping, for example Group Risk Index (GRI), or
Enterprise Risk Index (ERI). Utility of such level wise and aggregated analysis in the
information systems service quality had been reported by Miller et al. (2008).
We also develop computational system framework and workflow that exploit both
generic and specific project risk factors. We have deployed and validated this framework
and workflow in a 'Mid-sized Software Company (MISCO)' for more than two years.
Results and significant findings from MISCO have been presented. The principal
objective is to take a comprehensive look at some of the important concepts in risk
identification and measurement that apply to SSO industry from vendors' perspective,
and also to propose a set of Operational Risk Indices based on generic and projectspecific
risk factors. We propose that these can become part of IT and other related
service standards. The computational and workflow system framework developed and
validated in this paper can also be incorporated in relevant international standards. Such
upgrades in standards should facilitate SSO management to divert multiple scarce
resources to projects in greater need compared to some other projects.

Risk management for software services outsourcing industry
SSO is a mega growth industry. This industry has seen scores of young technocrats build
multi-million dollar enterprises. IT industry business models are very sophisticated, and
have given extra momentum and impetus to innovative financing models including
venture capital and equity markets, both private and public. Although most IT companies
begin as 'start ups' with shares held by only early stage financiers, they soon become
answerable to millions of shareholders after going public. Revenue predictability and
preserving shareholder value become important to such companies.
SSO companies have witnessed higher than average revenue, and margin growth
over the last several decades. Increasingly, however, the growth rates are under threat.
Past events such as the dotcom bust, terrorist strikes or recent event like meltdown in
global financial markets have meant cautious capital expenditure spends, and postponing
technology upgradation plans.
Consequently, ability of SSO industry to face adversities must increase to maintain
sustainable global competitiveness. Other more traditional industries such as Finance or
Manufacturing have been using sophisticated risk management techniques for decades;
and have benefited immensely. Indeed, it is impossible to visualise those industries
without risk management systems. Although SSO industry lagged initially, many companies
have started implementing risk management systems (Dasgupta and Mohanty, 2009),
enterprise risk management systems (Beasley et al., 2004) and special risk audits in
recent past (Brandas, 2010).

We examined all these standards and it could be seen that none of these standards
incorporate generic risk factors.
2.2
Managing SSO risks
SSO units the world over are implementing risk management systems. Focus of research
earlier was on software projects from the internal IT department's perspective, subsequent
researchers found substantial differences in the way risk is perceived and therefore,
should be managed by vendors. Important differences are as follows:
SSO vendors execute large number of projects. SSO vendors would typically
execute several hundred projects at any time. In-house IT projects are usually less in
number comparatively. SSO vendors have the need to aggregate risks. This is similar
to say Insurance industry, where risks are computed at an individual's level, as well
aggregated as a group.
SSO vendors have a need to mitigate risks at project level, as well as at aggregate
level.
SSO vendors have the need to link risk levels with the financial forecasting process.
A SSO vendor is a business entity and therefore, effective analysis of financial
performance is of much importance to it. Assessing risks and incorporating the same in
the final decision is an integral part of financial analysis (Chandra, 2003). Risk management
techniques are used in most major enterprises and considerable knowledge exists on how
to effectively assess and mitigate risks.

2.3
Risk classification
Although several risk classification schemes exist (Lam, 2003; COSO, 2004; Fight,
2004; Escobar and Seco, 2008), simple classifications that are sufficient for most
purposes, and are often used by risk professionals, recognise three major types of risks:
Market Risk: Prices will move in a way that has negative consequences for the
enterprise.
Credit Risk: A customer, counter party, or supplier will fail to meet its obligations.
Operational Risk: People, processes or systems will fail, or an external event (e.g.
earthquake, fire, etc.) will negatively impact the enterprise.
In general, risk managers would consider market risk and credit risk as financial risk, and
group all other risks as part of operational risk (Lam, 2003).
In this paper, the focus is on operational risks for a SSO. SSO companies can use
these Operational Risk Indices to decide which projects have more pressing needs to
receive additional resources in multiple resources constrained situations, and as a
forewarning tool to initiate mitigating actions on time.

Typical services provided by SSO industry
Software projects undertaken by most SSO companies can be classified into following
categories according to the nature of services provided:
Business Transformation and Consultancy Services.
Application: These are software used by client organisations that are custom
designed for in-house use by the clients themselves and not available for others.
Development: Developing and implementing new applications.
Maintenance: Enhancements, modifications and bug fixing of in-house
applications.
Re-engineering: Making application systems work with or without additional
features on a new technology or platform.
Localisation/Globalisation: Making the software serve different geographies and
languages.
Software Products: These are developed by software product companies, for use by
their customers. These are also referred to as 'packages'.
Development: Developing new or next generation products.
Sustenance: Similar to application maintenance, but usually tasked with
maintaining several past versions through out the life cycle of the software
product.
Re-engineering: Making products work with or without additional features on a
new technology or platform.
Localisation/Globalisation: Enabling products to serve different geographies and
languages.
Package Implementation: Software products such as ERP, BI Tools, etc. require
extensive customisation for client-specific purposes. This work is referred to as
package implementation.
Testing: A major source of revenues, these projects require extensive manual or
automated testing of software applications or products.
Production Support: These projects monitor and fix applications in use (often
referred to systems in production) such as an online credit processing system, or HR
management system etc. on 24 × 7 basis. Often involves minor modifications or bug
fixes as well.
Engineering and Hardware Design Services: Offer services such as digitisation,
CAD/CAM, PCB design, VLSI design, etc.
Business Process Outsourcing: Data processing and call handling services for
industries such as financial services, airlines, hospitality, etc.

Many SSO projects are undertaken using coordinators and analysts at client locations
(called onsite) with significant portion of software work done at company owned
development centres and are referred to as onsite-offshore projects.
Most SSO projects are usually billed on the following basis, with variations such as
per transaction, or profit sharing, etc.
A
B
Time and Material (T&M) billing model is used when the scope of the project
cannot be defined precisely, or for repetitive maintenance or production support type
work that go on for years. Services are charged on per person hour or person day
basis.
Fixed Price (FP) projects are used when the scope can be defined with reasonable
precision and efforts/schedules estimated in advance.
2.5
Software project risk factors
Dictionary definition of Risk (Oxford, 2005) is 'the possibility of something bad
happening in future; a situation that could be dangerous or have a bad result; any
business venture has an element of risk'. The major ingredient of risk is uncertainty. If
the consequences of an action or decision depend on the possible occurrence of other
events, then we term such actions or decisions as 'risky', if we cannot tell in advance
whether those events will happen or will not happen (Copas, 1999).
Researchers in the area of software risk management have been very active. Many
give credit to Barry Boehm and Tom Demarco for laying the foundation of Software
Risk management (Boehm, 1989; Boehm and Demarco, 1997) although they themselves
give credit to Michelangelo for using risk management techniques in 1547 while raising
the dome of St. Peters. They also call software development the 'ultimate risky business'.
One of the initial attempts to identify risk factors in software projects was made by
Henri Barki, Suzanne Rivard and Jean Talbot (Barki et al., 1993). They identified 24 risk
factors after a survey of 120 software projects. These factors were revalidated by Jiang et
al. (2002) over 152 software projects, and six factors were found through Exploratory
Factor Analysis. Several researchers have provided further insight into risks found in inhouse
or outsourced software projects (Mulcahy, 2003; Ethiraj et al., 2005; Cleary, 2008;
Gefen et al., 2008). Of particular interest is the work done by Hazel Taylor (Taylor,
2007). She has pointed out that while many risk factors for IT projects in general have
been identified in the literature; little thought have been given to the risk factors that are
of higher concern for managers of vendor driven (or outsourced) projects. She has
identified top risks in 'ERP implementation' type outsourced projects in Hong Kong.
Additional software project risks have been identified by international standards such
as the International Standards Organization (www.iso.org) or the Integrated Capability
Maturity Model CMMI® for software services from the Software Engineering Institute,
Carnegie Mellon University (SEI, 2009).
We have consolidated the major factors emerging from the above body of knowledge
into ten major categories. The factor categories and their explanations are given in Table 2.

Measuring software risk
The gold standard for decision-making is Expected Utility Theory - the optimal decision
is one that maximises expected utility, essentially the product of the probability of the
adverse event and the utility (negative loss), which will result if that event occurs. It is
well documented that in practice people's decision-making strategies do not accord at all
closely to this normative ideal, but nonetheless the decisions we make will still be strongly
influenced by perceived levels of risk (Copas, 1999).
Boehm (1989) proposed an approach, which is in agreement with the Expected
Utility Theory, and defined software risk exposure (RE) as:
RE = Prob (UO) ∗ Loss (UO)
(1)
where Prob (UO) is the probability of an unsatisfactory outcome and Loss (UO) is the
loss to the parties affected if the outcome is unsatisfactory.
Software practitioners adopted Boehm's approach, and several risk indices were soon
devised based on that approach. In situations where calculating probability and impact
were relatively easy, this technique was found to be very suitable (Leung, 1995).
In cases where several unsatisfactory outcomes are possible with probabilities Prob
(UOi), each with losses Loss (UOi) the total Risk Exposure can be computed as
n
RE = ∑ Probability (UOi ) × Loss (UOi )
i=1
For most software projects, calculating Prob (UO) was found to be difficult. This is an
experience shared by many practitioners, but it continues to be widely used (Mulcahy,
2003). To overcome difficulties in assessing probabilities of adverse events, a new
method was proposed (Barki et al., 1993). The alternative method proposes that:
Software development risk = (project uncertainty) ∗
(magnitude of potential loss due to project failure)
(2)
(3)
This approach differs in two major respects. First, it refers to uncertainty instead of
probability, and second, it refers to only one unsatisfactory outcome, i.e. project failure
instead of several unsatisfactory outcomes.
A comparison can be drawn between Barki's proposal and the risk indices used in
medical studies. For example, if a correlation is found to exist between smoking or
chewing tobacco with prevalence of cancer, chewing or not chewing tobacco can be used
to conclude a risky behaviour. If the person also smokes, it can be said that the behaviour
is even more risky. Therefore, a person who smokes and chews tobacco can be said to
have a higher risk index (and therefore possibility of getting cancer) than a person who
does neither or does either.
As software projects have intervening conditions, i.e. intervention by management
(Kutsch, 2008), it is often enough to identify projects exhibiting higher risk index
compared to other projects, to determine which projects are in need of management
attention in precedence over the others. This is similar to deciding which patients require
medical attention more urgently in a wartime field hospital.

J. Dasgupta and R.P. Mohanty
A computational and workflow system framework towards project risk
measurement
There are uncertainties associated with every software project. Some projects have more
uncertainties than others. For example, a project may have been bid in fixed price (FP)
mode due to competitive reasons but the requirements may not have been understood
fully. Or a key project member may have moved to another project and whether complete
knowledge had been transferred to another member is not known. Project uncertainties
fluctuate over time, going up when adverse events introduce uncertainties into the project,
and going down when the uncertainties are reduced. Higher uncertainty denotes more
risk that a project would not meet project objectives. In the absence of an instrument to
assess these uncertainties with reasonable accuracy, uniformity or reliability - management
may be forced to take ad-hoc decisions, and resources may not get assigned to the
projects in most distress. Management needs to know about risky projects for forewarning
as well. Accurate information about risky project allows management to inform stakeholders
including customers in advance, allowing mitigation actions on time.
4.1
Project risks and risk factors
Project risks are the chances of a project not meeting project objectives. Project objectives
may be low variance of actual efforts from estimated efforts, delivering on schedule,
meeting financial contribution goals, good quality, high customer satisfaction, etc.
Most SSO management would define project objective as meeting financial contribution
targets. Shortcomings in other areas such as quality (bad quality leads to re-work), effort
or schedule variance (more effort than previously estimated impacts project's profitability),
or customer dissatisfaction (if quality, costs and schedules are met; rarely customers have
reasons to be dissatisfied) should impact the projects financial contribution. We term
inability to meet financial contribution as Margin Loss.
Margin Loss = Actual Margin(%) − Expected Margin(%)

Project-Specific Risk Exposure (PSRE)
Method to compute PSRE is shown in the top panel of Figure 1, in the 'project specific
risk assessment' part. To compute project risk exposure due to specific and unique
situations, equation (2) has been adapted as:
where PSRE = Project Specific (or Unique) Risk Exposure
RPi = Risk Probability or probability of the ith risk event occurring
RCi = Risk Consequence or financial loss that may be caused if the ith risk event
occurs

PSRE is used to initiate project specific risk mitigation plans. These plans are directed at
prevention of project-specific risk events occurrence. To give an example, let as assume
that a particular project's manager has identified the following risk events, occurrence
probabilities and consequences:
Risk Event 1: The data link line connecting the server and client machines has gone down
for 32 hours at an average every year for the previous three years. Each lost hour
signifies a project billing loss of USD 4800.
Risk Event 2: The project has a Service Level Agreement (SLA) that high priority bugs
would be resolved in one working day. In the same previous three years, this SLA has
been breached at an average seven times in a year. Each SLA breach carries a financial
penalty of USD 3000.
PSRE of the project is computed as
32 × 4800 + 7 × 3000 = USD 174, 600.
This project can reduce the PSRE by getting a backup link in place, and through
reduction in SLA breach events. The plan on how these objectives can be met should be
documented in project-specific risk mitigation plans, and tracked in project reviews.
4.3
Project Generic Risk Index (PGRI)
PGRI is computed using equation (3) as shown in panel titled 'project generic risk factors
assessment' in Figure 1. In this process, the project manager uses a questionnaire shown
in Table 3 to assess uncertainty levels associated with each of the ten generic risk factors.

As can be seen in the sample questionnaire of Table 3, and in the risk management
process of Figure 2, project managers and risk auditors continuously monitor and report
the perceived magnitude of these ten risk factors, at least once every month. An example
of exact questions that may be asked has been given for factor 'Requirements'. Each
question measures the level by assigning values 1 to 5, spanning levels signifying very
low to very high.
Each risk factor can be assigned a weight. Weights are assigned in percentages, adding
up to 100% over all. The weights are assigned by a panel of senior project managers, and are
applied uniformly across all projects, irrespective of the type of project. As have been shown
in Table 3 and Figure 1, exact computation can be done by adapting equation (3) as
where Wk = weight assigned to risk factor k
RGk = value (between 1 and 5) assigned to factor k by project manager or risk
auditor
L = number of magnitude levels assigned to each Risk Factor (L = 5)
In equation (3), project uncertainty is multiplied by magnitude of potential loss. It is
difficult to estimate magnitude of potential loss due to project failure in the SSO context,
as the potential may span from penalty, to margin loss, to loss of all future business from
the customer. As can be easily understood, it is possible to take action to reduce risk
factor levels. For example, if project requirements are not well understood, the mitigation
action is to understand project requirements. There is not much point in estimating
potential loss, as the idea is to prevent such loss through effective lowering of risk factor
magnitude.
Further, multiplying the magnitude of potential loss with the uncertainty level makes
it difficult to compare PGRI as a bigger project could have a larger loss potential
compared to a smaller size project. Therefore we modify the equation to equation (6) to
facilitate decision making.
4.4
Group Generic Risk Index (GGRI)
As discussed earlier in this paper, SSOs typically executes projects in a group, for
example for a customer, or location or a domain. It is therefore necessary to devise indices
to estimate aggregated risk index of projects executed in groups. These indices are
termed Group Generic Risk Index (GGRI). GGRI is the Nth percentile (N is typically 80)
of all PGRIs of projects in the group. Percentile method is superior compared to arithmetic
average as averages often present misleading risk factor levels.
4.5
Enterprise Generic Risk Index (EGRI)
Rolling up GGRIs and taking the Mth percentile point (M is typically 80) can similarly
compute EGRI. N and M can be kept at the same value. Figure 1 describes the process
fully.

Workflow system
A workflow to use the computational framework is presented in Figure 2. Project
managers fill in project-specific risks, probabilities and consequences in a risk management
system. They also report generic risk factor scores using the risk management system,
once every month. The system computes PGRI, GGRI and EGRI. These indices are used
by trained risk auditors to identify projects with high risk (probability of showing high
margin loss) and subsequently subjecting these projects (or sometimes, groups) to detailed
and frequent audits. Through analysis of the resultant risk metrics and reports, detailed
mitigation plans are prepared and executed at project, group and enterprise levels.

SSO operational risk indices and risk management system:
a case example
A 'Mid-sized Software Services Company' (MISCO) is one of the leading global
providers of IT services and business solutions. Several thousand professionals service
clients across diverse industries, from sales offices across USA, Europe and Asia-Pacific,
and Global Delivery Centres located in many countries. MISCO has serviced numerous
Fortune 1000 companies, for over two decades.
Possibility and magnitude of margin loss therefore is the 'risk' that MISCO is trying to
minimise. It has been established at MISCO that there exists a significant correlation between
the magnitude of risk factors identified in Table 2 and Margin Loss defined in equation (4).
MISCO is an ISO 9000 (International Standards Organization, www.iso.org) certified
company. It has also been assessed at level 5 of SEI/CMMi (Integrated Capability
Maturity Model of the Software Engineering Institute, www.sei.cmu.edu). All projects
follow formal risk management and mitigation methods. Most of the project managers
have received formal training in project management, and several have formal project
management certifications from Project Management Institute (www.pmi.org) and others.
All managers have knowledge about formal software engineering processes and models.

J. Dasgupta and R.P. Mohanty
The risk management computational system and workflow using the operational risk
indices presented earlier has been deployed and validated at MISCO for more than
two years since 2007. The model is now fully validated having been used on more than a
thousand projects of all types described in Section 5.
Sample risk dashboards are shown in Figure 3. BU in the figure means 'Business
Units'. Risky (H/M) refer to High and Medium risk projects, a classification introduced
to distinguish between the risk levels of risky projects.

Significant findings
Some of the significant findings are presented briefly as follows:
•
•
•
It was found that high PGRI (and consequently GGRI) provides very effective risk
forewarning to management, allowing corrective and preventive mitigation actions
well in time. The indices failed to provide forewarning only for .02% (2 projects per
1000 projects) of the active projects, on yearly basis.
MISCO EGRI has come down by 7 points in two years. This reflects effective
assessment and mitigation actions on generic risk factors across the entire enterprise.
Monthly risk mitigation rate, defined as the percentage of risky projects that have
been brought out of high risky zone, averaged 20%. This means that a fifth of the
projects that were assessed as having a high probability of margin loss were
prevented from losing margin every month.

Analysis of these various risk indices allowed MISCO to identify organisation-wide
improvement areas. Effects of these improvements were clearly evident on GGRI
and EGRI.
Over 99% of the managers use the automated risk management system every month,
providing reliable and current PGRI, and allowing computation of GGRI and EGRI.
These indices were able to provide ample forewarning to management about the
projects that were likely to fail in meeting project objectives. Success rate achieved
in forewarning was 99.98% per annum, or 2 projects per 1000 per year. The indices
allowed management to initiate corrective and preventive actions in time at project,
and organisation levels, leading to reduction of risk indices across various business
units and projects.

Concluding remarks
This paper introduces the concept of software project generic risk factors, and proposes
that SSO-related standards and quality frameworks should include the concept of generic
risk factors. It also represents a case example and derives significant learning out of
application of a risk management framework. Case example represents a major global
player in the software services outsourcing industry, where the business dimensions
in terms of project management are circumscribed by multiple variety and widespread
diversity. Therefore, the example itself demonstrates the current realities of the
contemporary SSO industry. Therefore, the significant learnings of the case are
generalisable and have transferability to other companies. Apart from these, this paper
presents a set of ten software project risk factors that apply to projects of all types
commonly found in SSO industry. A computational system framework that can estimate
both project-specific and generic risk factors have been developed and validated. A
workflow system that can be deployed by SSO industry to exploit this computational
framework to manage software project risks through multi-criteria decision making, and
divert multiple scarce resources to projects most in need have been designed. It also
allows SSO industry management to undertake project-specific, group level and
enterprise level corrective and preventive risk mitigation actions on time. By using this
framework, MISCO has experienced prevention of substantial losses. Existing IT and
SSO-related standards do not mandate use of generic project risk factors, and focus
entirely on project-specific risk factors. The computational and workflow system
framework developed and validated in this paper can be incorporated in relevant
standards. This would deliver tremendous value to the global SSO industry.
SSO is a major industry and very rapidly growing and generating huge revenues
across the world. It also provides employment to millions of young talents. Continued
well-being of this industry would require these enterprises to reduce costs through
prevention of losses. Effective risk identification and prudent use of risk management
techniques will help SSO industry in achieving the objectives of cost reduction and loss
prevention. Although the risk management systems based on the indices presented in this
paper have been found to be effective at MISCO, it is felt that the PGRI computation can
be made more effective if Fuzzy Set based methods are used instead of crisp numbers
(Cong et al., 2008).
