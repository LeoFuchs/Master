ABSTRACT
Although software development projects increasingly incorporate virtual team members they still fall prey to risks which
produce challenges as do co-located projects. Most research performed on project risk was conducted on projects using
traditional co-located team members. This paper reports on the results of a survey of over 150 Information Technology (IT)
practitioners. One goal of the survey was to identify differences in the degree of impact between risk factors on virtual
software projects and those on co-located software projects. Out of fifty-five surveyed risk factors, seven risk factors showed
significant differences in impact on the successful completion of projects in these two types of project environments.
Additionally, the results showed a greater impact for each of the seven risk factors on virtual rather than co-located software
projects. These results can be useful to practitioners who are managing in a virtual environment and need to correctly
identify potential risks.

INTRODUCTION
Many factors, including advances in telecommunications, globalization and the cost and dangers of business travel (Jones,
2005) have fostered a move away from the traditional co-located project teams and toward use of virtual project teams.
However, while the use of virtual project teams is growing (Walther, 2005), the amount of research on this emerging project
environment type lags behind the volume of research on co-located projects. This is particularly true in the area of project
risk. Prior research has focused on project risk in co-located projects (Wallace, 2004; Barki, Rivard, & Talbot, 1993; Boehm,
1991; Keil, Lyytinen, & Schmidt, 1998) with little attention to virtual projects. This is true despite the fact that risk
management on projects has been identified as key to avoiding project problems, failures and even disasters (Addison &
Vallabh, 2002) (Cole, Connolly, & Dean, 1995). As early as 1991, Boehm identified risk management to be critical to
eliminating or reducing the occurrence of project risk (Boehm, 1991).
Certain aspects of virtual teams, such as trust and communication (DePillis & Furumo, 2006), have been researched in some
depth; however there has been no empirical study of the important risk factors on virtual software development projects
(Powell, 2004). Are the most important risk factors on software development projects which employ virtual teams the same
risks that were previously identified for traditional, co-located projects? Do risks have approximately the same level of effect
on the success of both co-located and virtual projects? A study of over 150 IT professionals was undertaken to determine the
answers to these questions. The focus of this paper will be the differences in the level of impact or effect of risk factors on
virtual versus co-located projects.
This paper begins with a discussion of the research's theoretical foundation and is followed by a description of the research
methodology. Next, a discussion of the results illustrates how seven risk factors were found to have a significantly greater
degree of impact on virtual software projects than on co-located software projects. The paper concludes with an evaluation
of the findings.
THEORETICAL FOUNDATION
Prior literature has theorized on methods of reducing the occurrence of project problems and failures. Many have even
proposed the use of risk management techniques to reduce or eliminate project failure (Addison & Vallabh, 2002) (Cole,

Differing Impact Levels from Risk Factors on Virtual and Co-Located Software Development Projects
Connolly, & Dean, 1995). Within risk management, the first step is risk identification, which is an attempt to identify and
document all possible risk factors for a specific project. The identification phase is followed by risk control, which involves
devising a strategy to address and control each identified risk. Research by Boehm, Barki, et al., Keil, et al. and Wallace has
produced lists of top risks on projects such as resource expertise, team diversity, technology and/or application complexities
and unrealistic budgets and schedules to name a few (Barki, Rivard, & Talbot, 1993) (Boehm, 1991) (Keil, Lyytinen, &
Schmidt, 1998) (Wallace, 2004). These lists of potential risks are considered to be beneficial in the risk identification phase
(Barki, Rivard, & Talbot, 1993). Unfortunately, prior research was conducted on projects involving traditional, co-located
project teams. A survey of prior literature reveals no such list exists for virtual software development projects. Therefore,
there is a need for research on which risk factors are important to virtual projects. In the absence of a project risk list specific
to the virtual environment, the lists of project risks developed for co-located projects have likely been used for all types of
project environments. This current research study seeks to identify which risk factors may have vastly different degrees of
impact on virtual versus co-located project teams.
Prior literature exists on virtual teams and virtual organizations, much of which focuses on investigating characteristics of
virtual project teams such as trust, conflict and communication (Kirkman & Mathieu, 2005) (Jones, Oyung, & Pace, 2005)
(Lipnack & Stamps, 1997). Other research identifies differences between virtual and traditional co-located teams.
Majchrzak, et al. specifically identified three major areas where virtual teams differ from traditional co-located teams
(Majchrzak, Malhotra, Stamps, & Lipnack, 2004):
1) Language and cultural differences
2) Work style differences
3) Problem solving approaches
Damian, et al. in their research found some communication-related benefits in virtual project teams over traditional colocated
teams when negotiating requirements among team members with “conflicting perspectives”. They felt the lack of
verbal cues that occurs without face-to-face communication may have actually been beneficial in resolving differences
(Damian, Shaw, & Gaines, 2000). On the other hand Dube and Robey in their research on virtual team paradoxes found a
need for face-to-face communication in some instances and benefits to not having face-to-face communication in others.
The researchers also pointed out the need for careful team member selection when building virtual teams due to their
differences from co-located teams. Virtual teams were in general found to be more flexible and had more ambiguities while
co-located teams were more structured (Dube & Robey, 2008).
METHODOLOGY
The methodology for this study was modeled after research methods used by prior researchers, such as Boehm, Barki, and
Wallace to identify top risk factors on co-located software projects. The main research method was a survey questionnaire
that was modeled after a questionnaire by Wallace (Wallace L. , 1999). The constructs of the questionnaire were the outcome
of a number of other methods namely face-to-face interviews and a focus group. First, a review of literature was conducted
to identify project risk factors from literature for inclusion in the questionnaire after the interviews and focus group session
were completed. Next, face-to-face interviews were conducted with project management practitioners using the first version
of the questionnaire. Open-ended questions in the questionnaire were used to identify a list of risk factors from the
practitioner point of view and to validate the list from the literature. Additionally, rich data was collected from the
practitioners as they described a specific project and the major issues they encountered. This step was followed by an
electronic focus group session which was held to identify any risk factors that may have been missed and to validate what
was found in the literature review and the face-to-face interviews. The large amount of data collected from these steps was
sorted and combined to produce a comprehensive list of fifty-five risk factors. At this point the questionnaire was modified
by replacing the open-ended questions with the list of fifty-five risk factors. Survey participants were asked to rate each of
the fifty-five risk factors on the degree of impact they had on the successful completion of their particular projects. A threepoint
Likert scale was used for this rating process where “1” indicated the risk factor had no impact on the project or simply
did not occur, “2” indicated the risk factor had a minor impact on the successful completion of the project and “3” indicated
the risk factor had a major impact on the successful completion of the project.
The questionnaire was piloted and then the revised version was widely distributed as an online survey. Most survey
participants were obtained through a purchased list and through solicitation of the international project management
association, Project Management Institute (PMI). Over 150 IT practitioners, i.e. project managers/leaders and systems
analysts each working on different projects completed the survey. Survey participants were asked to answer the
questionnaire based on a recent virtual software project if possible. If no experience with a virtual software project was

available, a recent co-located project could be substituted. This approach yielded data about both virtual and traditional
software projects allowing for some comparisons between project environments.

Differing Impact Levels from Risk Factors on Virtual and Co-Located Software Development Projects
The following sections will discuss each of these seven risk factors, outline the differences, and propose reasons for the
observed differences.
Seven Risk Factors
The first risk factor, Insufficient knowledge transfer showed the most significant difference in degree of impact (p-value <
.003). This risk factor refers to issues related to communication between project members when it involves a transfer of
knowledge. Knowledge in this case could refer to situations such as details of a software application, business process
procedures or project team workings. Of the virtual project team respondents, 28.40% of them indicated this risk factor
caused a major impact on project success while almost half that number of participants on co-located projects (14.89 %)
agreed. 61.70% of co-located project respondents indicated this risk factor had no impact or simply did not occur on their
projects while only 31.78% of virtual project respondents agreed. The results support this risk factor being an issue in a
virtual environment since a small percentage of virtual project respondents indicated there was no impact while at the same
time a large percentage of co-located project responses concurred. This difference between virtual and co-located project
types may have occurred because knowledge transfer methods are destined to be different in these two environments. Lack
of face-to-face communication is likely to make knowledge transfer much more difficult in a virtual environment. Dube and
Robey (2008) in their research on virtual teams found face-to-face communication to be advantageous in some situations.
Simpler methods of communication, i.e. status reporting can easily be accomplished via e-mail or other forms of electronic
communication. However, knowledge transfer usually involves a conversation between more than one person as well as
sharing of documents. Email does not lend itself to conversational exchanges of complex material and other tools which
work better in these situations such as teleconferencing, video conferencing or web conferencing may not be available to
virtual project team participants. Damian, et al. (2000) in their research found “multimedia meeting systems” enabled virtual
project teams to be more effective especially when there was conflict. Further, knowledge transfer may not be a significant
problem on most co-located projects because much of it takes place casually, simply as a result of people being near one
another. Jones, et al. (2005) indicate information sharing can be a challenge on virtual teams due to the absence of things like
routine face-to-face update meetings which are not available in a virtual environment. It is interesting that other
communication-related risk factors in the survey did not show significant differences. This suggests that all forms of
communication do not show differences based on project environment. The message here is that all virtual project managers
should take extra pains to facilitate knowledge transfer within their environment.
The Lack of project team cohesion risk factor showed a significant difference in degree of impact (p-value < .004). This risk
factor describes the risk that the project team does not work well together and therefore lacks cohesion. Problems with team
cohesion can occur when there is conflict between team members or even when the management of the team does not foster
relationships needed to work together as a team. Either of these situations can lead to team member isolation which can
contribute to less cohesion on a team. Jones, et al. (2005) indicate a feeling of isolation is one of the most common problems
when working on a virtual team. 17.76% of the virtual project team respondents indicated this risk factor caused a major
impact on their project success while less than half that number of participants on co-located projects (6.38 %) agreed. More
than two-thirds (70.21%) of co-located project respondents indicated this risk factor had no impact or simply did not occur on
their projects while less than half (41.12%) of virtual project respondents agree. The major impact percentages in the virtual
environment were not very high, but together with the minor impact percentages they indicate 58.88% of virtual project
respondents felt this risk factor had some impact on the successful completion of the project. More importantly, the
difference between the degree of impact in a virtual environment and a co-located environment is significant. This difference
may have occurred because co-located teams can form a bond more quickly than virtual teams due to face-to-face contact.
Although a virtual project team may eventually form a bond, it is still more difficult for some people to build relationships
through the use of electronic communication only.
The Cultural or language differences risk factor showed a significant difference in degree of impact (p-value < .02). This
risk factor describes the problems that can occur due to differences in language and/or culture among project team members.
The team members may speak different languages or they may all speak the designated project language, however, it may not
be a native language for some which can lead to misunderstandings. Cultural differences can also occur when team members
have a different understanding of a concept like timeliness and neither cultural group is aware a difference exists until a
problem or misunderstanding occurs. Cultural differences can be harder to detect than language differences. 14.02% of the
virtual project team respondents indicated this risk factor caused a major impact on their project success while less than half
that number of participants on co-located projects (6.38 %) agreed. From the opposite angle, more than two-thirds (70.21%)
of co-located project respondents indicated this risk factor had no impact or simply did not occur on their projects while less
than half (44.86%) of virtual project respondents agreed. Over half (55.14%) of virtual project respondents felt this risk

factor had some impact on the successful completion of the project, either major or minor. More importantly, the difference
between the degree of impact in a virtual environment and a co-located environment is significant. This difference may have
occurred because it is more likely to have team members with different cultural backgrounds on a virtual team since members
can be physically located in different cities, states or countries. These findings are in line with Lipnack and Stamps (1997)
who indicate virtual teams are certain to have difficulties with differences in culture, custom and languages. Dube and Robey
(2008) list cultural differences as just one area creating challenges for virtual team members. Interestingly, Lipnack and
Stamps (1997) theorize that cultural differences can be just as severe between team members with different professional
backgrounds as those from different countries. Future research could explore this question in more depth by inquiring about
the source of the cultural difference, i.e. country of origin or profession. Finally, Majchrzak, et al. (2004) identify language
and cultural differences as the first major area of differences between virtual and traditional co-located teams.
The Inadequate technical resources, i.e. hardware, processing availability risk factor showed a significant difference in
degree of impact (p-value < .02). This risk factor describes the issues that can occur when technical resources required by the
project team are not available or have limited availability. For instance, if the team needs to run test cycles on the company's
mainframe computer they may run into problems getting enough CPU processing time due to normal daily operations having
first priority. 12.15% of the virtual project team respondents indicated this risk factor caused a major impact on their project
success while less than half that number of participants on co-located projects (6.38 %) agreed. More than two-thirds
(72.34%) of co-located project respondents indicated this risk factor had no impact or simply did not occur on their projects
while almost half (47.66%) of virtual project respondents agreed. The major impact percentages in the virtual environment
were not very high, but together with the minor impact percentages they indicate 52.34% of virtual project respondents felt
this risk factor had some impact. More importantly, the difference between the degree of impact in a virtual environment and
a co-located environment is significant. This difference may have occurred because some technical resources that are not
usually required for co-located projects can be essential in virtual projects such as video conferencing equipment to improve
meetings and add a face-to-face communication component. Even smaller items such as scanners might be needed in a
virtual environment to aid in the exchange of hand written diagrams and written processes or procedures from users. Since a
key component of virtual teams involves the use of technical resources especially telecommunications in order to
communicate, the lack of these technical resources could damage the core of a virtual team. Mayer (1998) describes the
critical role of connectivity in virtual operations as “ubiquitous connectivity” which requires technical tools. In virtual
environments she refers to the need to communicate with anyone in any location at any time (Mayer, 1998). Damian, et al.
(2000) in their research also found a need for “multimedia meeting systems” to improve virtual team effectiveness.
The Resource inexperience with company and its' processes risk factor showed a significant difference in degree of impact
(p-value < .03). This risk factor describes issues that may occur if the project team members are not familiar with the
company as a whole, such as its' key goals and objectives or even procedures such as those for implementing software or
requesting test cycle runs. 27.10% of the virtual project team respondents indicated this risk factor caused a major impact on
their project success while only about a third of that number of participants on co-located projects (8.51 %) agreed. More
than half (55.32%) of co-located project respondents indicated this risk factor had no impact or simply did not occur on their
projects while less than half (38.32%) of virtual project respondents agreed. The difference in degree of impact may have
occurred because it is common for virtual team members to work at different company site locations. Within the same
company there may be differences in processes and procedures from one work site to another and team members may not
realize this unless a problem occurs will trying to complete a task together. On the other hand, team members at the same
location may experience some differences from department to department but they may be able to resolve them with face-toface
meetings. Jones et al. (2005) explain these types of problems can occur in decentralized organizations (with many site
locations) when no centralized function exists to “mandate standards”. Since software development involves many standards
for tasks ranging from code creation to implementation, problems on virtual teams in this area are understandable.
The Loss of key resource(s) that impact the project showed a significant difference in degree of impact (p-value < .04). This
risk factor describes the risk that the project may be thrown off course when an important team member leaves the project
before completion. 31.78% of the virtual project team respondents indicated this risk factor caused a major impact on their
project success while only 19.15% of participants on co-located projects agreed. Almost two-thirds (61.70%) of co-located
project respondents indicated this risk factor had no impact or simply did not occur on their projects while less than half
(39.25%) of virtual project respondents agreed. Again, the importance of these percentages is the significant difference in the
responses from virtual software project respondents as compared to co-located software project respondents. This difference
may have occurred because virtual teams have the advantage of being able to recruit the “best of the best” from anywhere in
the world unlike co-located teams. If the virtual project team is made up of these types of experts then the loss of a key team
member could have a greater impact due to a greater level of expertise that may be very difficult to replace. A greater sense

Differing Impact Levels from Risk Factors on Virtual and Co-Located Software Development Projects
of team member interdependence and responsibility can occur on virtual teams which may consequently cause a larger gap to
fill once a resource leaves the team (Hoefling, 2003).
The Hidden agendas impact the project risk factor showed a significant difference in degree of impact (p-value < .05). This
risk factor describes the issues that can occur when one or more project team members have a hidden agenda they are trying
to accomplish while working on the project. 27.10% of the virtual project team respondents indicated this risk factor caused
a major impact on their project success while 14.89% of participants on co-located projects agreed. More than half (57.45%)
of co-located project respondents indicated this risk factor had no impact or simply did not occur on their projects while more
than a third (36.45%) of virtual project respondents agreed. The large percentage of co-located project respondents who felt
this risk factor had no impact seems to indicate this risk factor is a non-issue in the co-located environment as compared to
the smaller number of virtual project respondents. Hidden agendas at their core are related to trust. When trust exists among
team members, a hidden agenda would be a breach of that trust. Trusting team members are not likely to expect fellow team
members to have hidden agendas. Trust is also one of the key concerns in virtual teams and Hoefling (2003) indicates trust is
the most common barrier for virtual teams. Additionally, these results may have occurred because hidden agendas can be
easier to mask on a team where there is little or no face-to-face communication. The lack of non-verbal cues can make a
hidden agenda truly invisible to virtual team members as opposed to co-located team members.
DISCUSSION
The graph below in Figure 1 shows a comparison of the participant response percentages for the “No Impact” rating. This is
an indication of how many survey participants felt each of the seven risk factors either did not impact the successful
completion of their project or simply did not occur on their project. The graph helps to illustrate the significant difference in
degree of impact between virtual software projects and co-located software projects for these seven risk factors. In each case,
the largest percentage of project participants who indicated the seven risk factors were non-issues worked on a co-located
project team while only about a third to a half of virtual project participants felt each of these risk factors had no impact.

The next graph in Figure 2 shows a comparison of the participant response percentages for the “Major Impact” rating. This is
an indication of how many survey participants felt each of the seven risk factors had a major impact on the successful
completion of their project, possibly changing the outcome from successful to unsuccessful. The graph helps to illustrate the
significant difference in the degree of impact between virtual software projects and co-located software projects for these

seven risk factors. In each case, almost twice as many virtual project respondents indicated the risk factor had a major impact
as the co-located project respondents.

CONCLUSION
These results would be helpful in several ways to project management practitioners who have worked on co-located software
projects and are new to virtual software projects. First, the results support the need for a project risk list specific to virtual
software projects and the danger in using the traditional, co-located project risk list. Second, these results provide insight into
some risk factors that are likely to be more pronounced on virtual software projects and must be monitored more closely in a
virtual environment such as:
• Insufficient knowledge transfer
• Lack of project team cohesion
• Cultural or language differences
In conclusion, the survey results indicated seven out of the fifty-five risk factors showed significant differences in the degree
of impact on the successful completion of the project for virtual software projects versus co-located software projects.
Additionally, in every case, the results for each of these seven risk factors indicated participants felt there was a greater
degree of impact on the successful completion of the project on virtual software projects than on co-located software projects.
Significant differences were expected, but significant differences pointing to a more severe impact on virtual software
projects was unexpected. It is important to note that the participants were not giving general opinions of their views of
projects but were answering questions based on actual projects they participated in or led. Future research could further
investigate the impact of these seven risk factors on virtual software projects and why the differences in impact occur.
