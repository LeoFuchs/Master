1.1
Risk of Software Develop
Frequent Staff Turnover
The frequent staff turnover not only causes higher business costs but also increases
risk of project schedule, and even leads to failure of the project.
1.2
User Requirement Is Not Clear
Small and medium-sized software companies tend to have received a certain range of
projects; the salient features of such projects are for specific functional requirements
and to meet certain product, so if the end product of such a project does not meet
user's true needs, it can be said a failure of the project. Unfortunately, many users are
not clear their own needs before they used the true product, moreover, software
development company itself paid insufficient attention to the definition of demand,
the reason is the conduct of the closed-door development, that leads the results also
can not be imagined.
1.3
Changing in User Needs
As many fast-changing needs of software projects, even many projects have not been
delivered, they can not meet user needs now. Many of the software development
companies are lack of awareness about this, there is no limit to the relevant provisions
in the contract, resulting in the risks of changes in demand can only be undertaken by
the enterprises themselves.

Plan Is Not Well
Because most of personnel in the small and medium-sized software companies have
multitask, the project management is not made by professional project managers, the
project plan is often a simple division of total progress, and this segmentation process
is almost non-consider the risk factors.
1.5
Insufficient Cost Evaluate
In order to get orders small and medium-sized software enterprises tend to deviate
from the cost of making the offer which is lower than the actual estimated cost.
1.6
Lack of Experience of Risk Management
Most small and medium-sized software enterprises project development process is
very immature, regardless of the use of the model of development process or project
planning; there are almost no contents of risk management.
1.7
Low Software Process Maturity
Although the software process models have been proposed for many years, but the
small and medium-sized software enterprises adopt the model for project management
is not long, and many companies nominally got the CMM certification, the actual
project management situation is far did not meet the requirements of the
corresponding level.
1.8
Excessive Use of New Technology
For small and medium-sized software enterprises, the key technology is often
mastered in a few hands, and because the software development industry has been in a
rapid update of the state, people are always talking about the latest technology, the
best architecture, the perfect solution for program, coupled with the software
development industry professionals have passion for the pursuit of new things, new
technologies and customers have blind worship for almost every project using the
latest technology, which allows developers to adapt to the new software development
and structure, it causes system-level problems almost impossible to be solved.
1.9
Lack of Internal Communication
In many small and medium-sized software companies the fact is that the staff
structure has almost beyond recognition from the beginning to the ending of the
development. This condition makes the new employee don't understand the
development process made by different engineers. In other cases, in order to obtain
orders the management department is lack of communication with the development
department, resulting in project development failure.

Risk Factor Survey
This paper adopts methods of qualitative and quantitative to study the risk factor
survey.
Firstly, qualitative research is based on interviews who are senior experts and
managers working in related businesses in Xi'an Software Park, whose purpose is to
identify specific risk factors for the implementation of staff. Meanwhile, in order to
ensure the integrity of research, through the study of domestic and foreign software
project risk summary of the relevant literature on software project risk factors for
synthesis.
Secondly, quantitative research is based on questionnaire, the research objects are
the practice of software project managers, following with evaluating and summarizing
the identified software project risk factors, and then analyzing the internal
relationships, revealing the laws of software project risk.
2.1
Risk Factors Assumptions
We can analyze the risk factors in small and medium-sized software enterprises of
project development with software life cycle. Software life cycle includes
requirements analysis phase, design and planning phase, coding phase, testing phase,
the running phase, acceptance inspection phase and maintenance stage. The first four
phases are software development phase, which is a critical stage for software risk.
This paper analyzes project risk factors in the small and medium-sized software
enterprises, mainly focusing on the first four stages of software life cycle. Meanwhile
factor analysis for each stage of the same risk factors may exist, but their role is not
the same. We summarize the project risk from previous research findings, and at the
same time, list risk factors assumptions table of project development in small and
medium-sized software companies, as shown in Table 1.
2.2
Experts Interview
Currently the software project risk research is still in its infancy, but foreign scholars
on software project risk research findings can not properly reflect the development of
China's small and medium software enterprise project features. Therefore, on the basis
of preliminary studies, we primarily adopt telephone interviews and field interviews
the two ways to study the problems of software project risk. By interviewing experts,
managers and supervisors who are engaging in long-term software development
project, know their software development experience, and understand their point of
view. According to the views of experts, after adjustment, we draw the risk factor
analysis table, as shown in Table 2.

Questionnaire Distribution and Recycling
We designed two kind of questionnaires: written questionnaire and electronic
questionnaires. The written questionnaire was distributed mainly in Xi'an, a total of
25 questionnaires were recovered, of which 21 were valid responses. The recovery of
electronic questionnaires was a total of 110, of which 80 questionnaires were valid.

Identification of Key Risk Factors
Identification of key risk factors is to identify those who have a significant impact on
project performance, which may lead to risk the consequences of the risk factors.
Identifying key risk factors, namely through the analysis of the results of the survey,

Research on Project Development Key Risk Factors
145
Based on table 4ï¼We explore its inner contact and name each factor as the following
factor nameï¼
F1 common factor consists of three risk factors which are frequent changes to
requirements planning; unclear statement of user requirement; and lack of
communication with the user.
These three indicators are mostly around requirement risk which is a direct encounter
with the description of the project requirement analysis, requirements definition,
associated risks, so the risk factor is defined as the public requirement risk.
F2 common factor contains two risk factors which are the development process is not
standardized and system testing has deficiencies. This common factor is defined as
the risk of technical risk.
F3 common factor contains two risk factors, namely, system scalability and lack of
maintenance; lack of cost and schedule monitoring. This risk factor is defined as the
project implementation risk
F4 common factor contains two risk factors, namely, team members changed
frequently, the responsibilities and the rights, are unclear; not timely delivering. This
risk factor is defined as organization and management risk.
F5 common factor consists of three risk factors, namelyï¼quality control aspects are
ignored; quality assurance system has not been effectively implemented; and lack of
quality standards. These three indicators is about quality risk management, so it is
defined as the quality management risk.

Conclusion
In analyzing the characteristics of small and medium-sized software enterprises, based
on the reference list of existing data of risk factors, used expert interviews and
questionnaire survey method, to identify risk factors for small and medium software
company's project development. We proposed user requirement risk, technical risk,
project implementation risk, organizational and management risk and quality
management risk, which are 5 classifications and 12 risk factors. These risk factors
form the small and medium-sized software enterprises project development risk index
system; it plays a fundamental role in project risk assessment and analysis for small
and medium-sized software enterprise, and also supports risk management and control
for small and medium software companies.
