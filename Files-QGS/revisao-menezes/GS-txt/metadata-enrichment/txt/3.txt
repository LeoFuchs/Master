Scoping Software Projects. The key to risk management is to be as complete as possible in identifying project risks. This paper discusses the project-seeping process. which is being successfully used by software developers at AT&T Global Information Solutions. Project scoping is a method or process used for identifying and assessing risks to determine a projects feasibility. Lists of requirement categories and risk factors are provided as facilitating tools. Project scoping provides a basis for defining a less risky project and for redefining or discontinuing projects that are too risky. The project-scoping process also provides a basis for continuously monitoring risks during development to detect emerging problems at the earliest possible moment-while there is still time to take effective corrective action. Thus, project management can focus on development problems in addition to tracking schedule compliance. The bottom line is that by implementing project scoping, management has better control over a project.
