Event-based attack against remote state estimation. Â© 2015 IEEE.Security issues in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) have gained increasing attention in recent years due to the vulnerability of CPS to cyber attack. This paper focuses on designing an intelligent online attack, which can compromise a sensor, eavesdrop measurements and inject false feedback in- formation, against remote state estimation. From the viewpoint of the attacker, we design an event-based attack strategy to degrade the estimation quality with arbitrary communication rate constraint. The approximate minimum mean-squared error estimation algorithm at the attacker side is derived under the Gaussian assumption. Furthermore, the relation between the attack threshold and the scheduling threshold is obtained in a closed form. Two examples are provided to demonstrate the main results.
