Modeling of Local False Data Injection Attacks With Reduced Network Information. Â© 2010-2012 IEEE.Modern power grids are becoming more prone to cyberattacks. Even worse, an attacker without the full topology and parameter information of a power grid can still execute a false data injection attack without being detected by the state estimator. This paper proposes an efficient strategy for determining the optimal attacking region that requires reduced network information. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified through extensive simulations. This paper introduces a new front in the study of smart grid cyber security: determination of a feasible attacking region by obtaining less network information. This paper is also essential and significant for finding effective protection strategies against false data injection attacks based on the deep understanding of the mechanisms and strategies of the attacks.
