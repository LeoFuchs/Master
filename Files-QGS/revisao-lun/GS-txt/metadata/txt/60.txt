An algebraic detection approach for control systems under multiple stochastic cyber-attacks. Â© 2014 Chinese Association of Automation. In order to compromise a target control system successfully, hackers possibly attempt to launch multiple cyberattacks aiming at multiple communication channels of the control system. However, the problem of detecting multiple cyber-attacks has been hardly investigated so far. Therefore, this paper deals with the detection of multiple stochastic cyber-attacks aiming at multiple communication channels of a control system. Our goal is to design a detector for the control system under multiple cyberattacks. Based on frequency-domain transformation technique and auxiliary detection tools, an algebraic detection approach is proposed. By applying the presented approach, residual information caused by different attacks is obtained respectively and anomalies in the control system are detected. Sufficient and necessary conditions guaranteeing the detectability of the multiple stochastic cyber-attacks are obtained. The presented detection approach is simple and straightforward. Finally, two simulation examples are provided, and the simulation results show that the detection approach is effective and feasible.
