A coordinated multi-switch attack for cascading failures in smart grid. This paper explores distributed smart grid attack strategies to destabilize power system components using variable structure system theory. Here, an opponent is able to remotely control multiple circuit breakers within a power system, say through data corruption or communication network attack, to destabilize target synchronous generators through application of state-dependent breaker switching. In contrast to attack via a single breaker, the multi-switch case provides additional degrees of freedom that can lead to stealthier and wide-scale cascading failures. We provide a dynamical systems context for formulating distributed multi-switch strategies and execute such attacks on the New England 10-generator 39-bus test system. Â© 2010-2012 IEEE.
