Online deception attack against remote state estimation. Â© IFAC.Security issue has become a new hotspot in cyber-physical systems (CPS) research field in recent years due to the vulnerability of CPS to security threats. This paper focuses on stealthy deception attack in remote state estimation, which is one typical attack in CPS. From the standpoint of deception attacker, we investigates how to design proper deception attack strategy to degrade the state estimation quality with communication rate constraint. We design an online attack strategy and prove that the proposed attack strategy can degrade the estimation quality. To study the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, we analyze the cost deviation, which depicts the difference between the estimation quality with and without the proposed attack strategy. Our results show that the cost deviation will be maximum when the communication rate is 0.75. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the main results.
