On multi-input controllable linear systems under unknown periodic DoS jamming attacks. Â© Copyright SIAM.In this paper, we study remotely controlled and observed multi-input controllable continuous linear systems, subject to periodic Denial-of-Service (DoS) jamming attacks. We first design a control and triggering strategy provenly capable of beating any partially known jammer via properly placing the closed-loop poles. Building on it, we then present an algorithm that is able to guarantee the system stability under unknown jamming attacks of this class. The functionality of this algorithm is also theoretically proven.
