Energy-based attack detection in networked control systems. The increased prevalence of attacks on Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) as well as the safety-critical nature of these systems, has resulted in increased concerns regarding the security of CPS. In an effort towards the security of CPS, we consider the detection of attacks based on the fundamental notion of a system's energy. We propose a discrete-time Energy-Based Attack Detection mechanism for networked cyber-physical systems that are dissipative or passive in nature. We present analytical results to show that the detection mechanism is effective in detecting a class of attack models in networked control systems (NCS). Finally, using simulations we illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in detecting attacks. Copyright 2014 ACM.
