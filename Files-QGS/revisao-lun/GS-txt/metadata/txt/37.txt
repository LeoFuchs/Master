A resilient feedback linearization control scheme for smart grids under cyber-physical disturbances. Â© 2015 IEEE.A cyber-enabled parametric control scheme is proposed for efficient transient frequency and phase stabilization in the power grid. Different implementations of the proposed control are investigated in this work. First, a centralized control scheme is proposed where the controller relies on timely phasor measurement unit (PMU) information about the grid to employ fast-acting energy storage systems for stabilization. Further, a decentralized controller implementation assumes information about the rest of the grid is not available, and hence acts based on local PMU measurements. For the case of cyber attacks targeting communication channels and resulting in large delays or absence of PMU data, we propose a robust combined control scheme where the controller operates in a centralized mode by default and switches to the decentralized scheme if PMU information is delayed or not available. Numerical results show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed controller against physical and cyber-physical disturbances in the 39-bus 10-generator New England power system.
