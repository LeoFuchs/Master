State summation for detecting false data attack on smart grid. The SE (state estimation) is an essential part of future smart grid for estimating its running state based on meter measurements. While it has been presented that the attacker can conduct a type of FDA (false data attack) which bypasses bad data detectors recently. In the paper general analysis about protection strategy and how to find a sparse attack, secure meters are discussed. Then by considering the impact of injection data, two detectors are proposed to detect the attack using state variables' distributions. In addition, we formalize the problem as a hypothetical test of standard normal distribution with empirical data. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our detectors comparing with classical detectors.Â©2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
