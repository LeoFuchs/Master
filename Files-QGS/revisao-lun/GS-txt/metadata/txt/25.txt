Further results on fault detection and isolation of malicious nodes in Multi-hop Control Networks. Â© 2015 EUCA.A Multi-hop Control Network (MCN) consists of a LTI system where the communication between sensors, actuators and computational units is supported by a (wireless) multi-hop communication network and data flow is performed using scheduling, routing and network coding of sensing and actuation data. In this paper we extend our previous results in [6] on the Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) problem over a MCN where the plant is a MIMO system and the communication nodes are subject to permanent failures and malicious attacks. In particular, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions such that the FDI problem can be solved with much milder assumptions on the malicious signal.
