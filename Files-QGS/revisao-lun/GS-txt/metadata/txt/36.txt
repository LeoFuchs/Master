Optimal control in the presence of an intelligent jammer with limited actions. We consider a dynamic zero-sum game between two players. The first player acts as a controller for a discrete time LTI plant, while the second player acts to jam the communication between the controller and the plant. The number of jamming actions is limited. We determine saddlepoint equilibrium control and jamming strategies for this game under the full state, total recall information structure for both players, and show that the jammer acts according to a threshold policy at each decision step. Various properties of the threshold functions are derived and complemented by numerical simulation studies. Â©2010 IEEE.
