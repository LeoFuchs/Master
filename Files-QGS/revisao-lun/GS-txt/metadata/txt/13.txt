On analysis and design of stealth-resilient control systems. The interest in cyber-physical system security has been growing exponentially in the last five years as the research community has realized that control loops embedded in complex systems can be compromised once attackers are capable to breach the cyber intrusion protection and detection systems. In this paper, we consider the class of attacks known as stealth attacks where the attacker can compromise information flow between all remotely located components of a closed-loop control system. We develop design strategies that can prevent or make stealth attacks difficult to be carried out. Our methods enhance a legacy system, so that stealth attacks can be detected and counteracted at the cost of an increased system complexity. Â© 2013 IEEE.
