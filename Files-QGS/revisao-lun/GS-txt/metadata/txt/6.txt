Controllability of dynamical systems: Threat models and reactive security. We study controllability and stability properties of dynamical systems when actuator or sensor signals are under attack. We formulate a detailed adversary model that considers different levels of privilege for the attacker such as read and write access to information flows. We then study the impact of these attacks and propose reactive countermeasures based on game theory. In one case-study we use a basic differential game, and in the other case study we introduce a heuristic game for stability. Â© Springer International Publishing 2013.
