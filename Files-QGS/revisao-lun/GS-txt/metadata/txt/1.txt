Safe and secure networked control systems under denial-of-service attacks. We consider the problem of security constrained optimal control for discrete-time, linear dynamical systems in which control and measurement packets are transmitted over a communication network. The packets may be jammed or compromised by a malicious adversary. For a class of denial-of-service (DoS) attack models, the goal is to find an (optimal) causal feedback controller that minimizes a given objective function subject to safety and power constraints. We present a semi-definite programming based solution for solving this problem. Our analysis also presents insights on the effect of attack models on solution of the optimal control problem.
