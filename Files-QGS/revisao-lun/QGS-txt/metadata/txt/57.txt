Quickest Detection of False Data Injection Attack in Wide-Area Smart Grids. Â© 2015 IEEE.We consider the sequential (i.e., online) detection of false data injection attacks in smart grid, which aims to manipulate the state estimation procedure by injecting malicious data to the monitoring meters. The unknown parameters in the system, namely the state vector, injected malicious data and the set of attacked meters pose a significant challenge for designing a robust, computationally efficient, and high-performance detector. We propose a sequential detector based on the generalized likelihood ratio to address this challenge. Specifically, the proposed detector is designed to be robust to a variety of attacking strategies, and load situations in the power system, and its computational complexity linearly scales with the number of meters. Moreover, it considerably outperforms the existing first-order cumulative sum detector in terms of the average detection delay and robustness to various attacking strategies. For wide-area monitoring in smart grid, we further develop a distributed sequential detector using an adaptive sampling technique called level-triggered sampling. The resulting distributed detector features single bit per sample in terms of the communication overhead, while preserving the high performance of the proposed centralized detector.
