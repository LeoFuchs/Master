Biologically inspired hierarchical cyber-physical multi-agent distributed control framework for sustainable smart grids. Â© Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.It is well known that information will play an important role in enhancing emerging power system operation.However, questions naturally arise as to when the increased data-dependence may be considered excessive. Two practical considerations emerge: 1) communications and computational overhead, in which redundant and irrelevant information acquisition and use results in heavy computational burden with limited performance return, and 2) increasing risks of cyber attack whereby indiscriminate cyber-dependence and -connectivity increases attack scope and impact. In this chapter, we present a hierarchical cyber-physical framework of power system operation based on flocking theory in the context of the smart grid stability problem. We study strategies to harness an appropriate degree of cyber technology by effectively leveraging physical couplings. Our formulation enables the identification of large-scale distributed control strategies for robust power grid operation. Furthermore, our formulation also enables a novel witness-based cyber-physical protocol whereby physical coherence is leveraged to probe and identify phasor measurement unit data corruption and estimate the true information values for attack mitigation.
