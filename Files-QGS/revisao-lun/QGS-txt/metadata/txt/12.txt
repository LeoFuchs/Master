Detecting False Data Injection Attacks on DC State Estimation. State estimation is an important power system application that is used to estimate the state of the power transmission networks using (usually) a redundant set of sensor measurements and network topology information. Many power system applications such as contingency analysis rely on the output of the state estimator. Until recently it was assumed that the techniques used to detect and identify bad sensor measurements in state estimation can also thwart malicious sensor measurement modification. However, recent work by Yao et al. [1] demonstrated that an adversary, armed with the knowledge of network configuration, can inject false data into state estimation that uses DC power flow models without being detected. In this work, we explore the detection of false data injection attacks of [1] by protecting a strategically selected set of sensor measurements and by having a way to independently verify or measure the values of a strategically selected set of state variables. Specifically, we show that it is necessary and sufficient to protect a set of basic measurements to detect such attacks.
