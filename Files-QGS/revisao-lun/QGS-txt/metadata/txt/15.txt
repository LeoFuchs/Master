Event-triggered control over unreliable networks subject to jamming attacks. Â© 2015 IEEE. Event-triggered networked control of a linear dynamical system is investigated. Specifically, the dynamical system and the controller are assumed to be connected through a communication channel. State and control input information packets between the system and the controller are attempted to be exchanged over the network only at time instants when certain triggering conditions are satisfied. We provide a probabilistic characterization for the link failures which allows us to model random packet losses due to unreliability in transmissions as well as those caused by malicious jamming attacks. We obtain conditions for the almost sure stability of the closed-loop system, and we illustrate the efficacy of our approach with a numerical example.
