Security concepts for the dynamics of autonomous vehicle networks. The secure operation of autonomous vehicle networks in the presence of adversarial observation is examined, in the context of a canonical double-integrator-network (DIN) model. Specifically, we study the ability of a sentient adversary to estimate the full network's state, from noisy local measurements of vehicle motions. Algebraic, spectral, and graphical characterizations are provided, which indicate the critical role of the inter-vehicle communication topology and control scheme in achieving security.
