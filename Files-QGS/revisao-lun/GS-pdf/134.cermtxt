Abstract-This paper studies the vulnerability of AC state
estimation (SE) with respect to a class of unobservable statepreserving
topology attacks, in which the topology data are
changed by attacker while the states remain unchanged. An
algorithm based on breadth-first search (BFS) is developed to determine
the subset of topology data and measurements required to
launch successful unobservable state-preserving topology attacks.
It is shown that the proposed algorithm can enable an attacker
to obtain the localized topology and corresponding measurement
data to mount an attack that bypasses bad data detector and
successfully changes topology information of the system in the
cyber layer.
Keywords-Cyber physical system security, power system state

I. INTRODUCTION
Topology information plays an essential role in power
system operation. In energy management systems (EMSs), various
data processing modules including state estimation (SE),
contingency analysis (CA), and optimal power flow (OPF)
are highly dependent on topology information. Cyber attacks
that alter the system topology information can result in wrong
solutions within these modules with potential consequences
including systematic problems and failures.
There has beenmuch recent interest in understanding the
cyber-security challenges facing the electric power system. In
[1], the authors introduce a class of false data injection (FDI)
attacks for DC SE and show that an attacker with suficient
system knowledge can inject malicious measurements without
beingdetected by existing bad data detection techniques that
are subsequent to SE. In [2], Kosut et al. demonstrate that the
algebraic condition for unobservableFDI attack is equivalent
to that of network observability.In [3], the authors focus on
FDI attacks on AC SE and introduce a class of unobservable
attacks that are limited to a sub-graph of the network. They
demonstrate that the knowledge of both system topology and
states are required to launch unobservableFDI attacks on AC
SE. In [4], the authors demonstrate that unobservableFDI
attacks on AC SE can lead to a physical generation re-dispatch
when none was needed.
Yet another class of FDI attacks is one that alters topology
data in an unobservable mannerI.n [5], Kim and Tong formally
introduce an unobservabletopology attack as a specicfi class of
FDI attacks on power systems and evaluate the attack's impact
on the locational marginal prices (LMPs). The authors design
the attack to alter the system topology estimate by injecting
malicious measurements and false line status data. Topology
attacks for DC SE are also studied in [6] and [7].
In this paper, we focus on a non-linear system model (i.e.,
AC SE) and on a class of unobservabletopology attacks in
which an attacker can change topology information of the
system without changing the states. We henceforth refer to
such attacks as unobservable state-preserving topology attacks.
These attacks can beof two types: line-maintaining and lineremoving:
for a line-maintaining attack, the attacker changes
measurements and line status information to make it appear
that line which is not in the system is now shown as active at
the control center via SCADA data; the opposite is achieved by
a line-removing attack. The paper [5] introduces unobservable
state-preserving topology attacks; however the analysis in [5]
is restricted to line-removing attacks. To launch such attacks,
the authors propose an attack heuristic in which the attacker
can set the power flow measurements for a specific line to zero
and change the power injection measurements at the end buses
of that line.
In this paper, we focus on a class of unobservablestatepreserving
line-maintaining attacks. We seek to understand the
minimum amount of information an attacker needs to launch
such attacks. We assume the attacker is aware of a physical
outage in the system and changes the resulting SCADA data
(prior to SE) to make it appear that the line is in service. We
denote such a line as the target line hereinaeftr. Specicfially,
false line oflw measurements need to becreated for the target
line; however, this cannot be achieved by just adjusting the
measurements at the end buses and requires estimating states
at those buses as well, since the flow on the outage line has to
becomputed. For a reliablestate estimate, the attacker needs to
identify a physical connection (we denote as path hereinafter)
between the end buses of the target line, over which it can
estimate states with local measurements, and thereby, create
an unobservableattack. However, there are multiple such paths
in the system. To create an attack with the smallest set of
information, the attacker needs to find the shortest path. Since
the power system can be represented as an undirected and
unweighted graph, algorithms such as Dijkstra's and BellmanFord,
which are used to find the shortest path in directed and
weighted graph, are not suitable in this problem. Therefore,
we propose an algorithm based on breadth-first search (BFS),
which is generally used for traversing or searching graph data
structures [8]. We need such an algorithm to search for the
shortest path that connected the end buses of the target line in
power system.
II. MATHEMATICALMODEL
In this section, we first introduce the system network and
topology processor models. Then we provide a short review of
mathematical formulation for AC SE and baddata detection.
Throughout, we assume there are nb buses, nbr branches, and
nz measurements in the system.
A. System Network and Topology Processor
The electric power system can berepresented bya graph
9 = {N, E} where Nand E are the sets of buses and
lines, respectively. For a specicfi system, we assume the static
topology is 90 = {No, Eo} where No and Eo are the sets of
all existing buses and branches, respectively. Then, the static
connectivity of the buses with lines can be represented with
nbr x nb "from" and "to" line-to-bus incidence matrices AKJ
and AKt, respecttively. If a line k exists to contnect bus i to
bus j, the (k, i) h element of AKJ and (k, j) h element of
AKt are I and all other entries of AKJ and AKt are set to
zeros. The overall nbr x nb line-to-bus incidence matrix AKN
is calculated using AKJ and AKt as follows
AKN = AKJ - AKt·
At the control center, SCADA collects line status data as a
nbr x 1 vector s with entries Sk E {O, I} for k E {I, ...,nbr}
that indicate the on and of status of circuit-breakers on
each line. The data is then passed to a topology processor
which maps the real-time power system topology along with
network connectivity data. The complete topology information
is captured bytwo matrices Ybn the branchadmittance matrix,
and Ybus, the bus admittance matrix, defined as
and
Ybr = D [diag(s)AKNJ,
Ybus = [diag(s)AKNJTD [diag(s)AKNJ
(2)
(3)
where D denotes the nbr x nbr branchadmittance matrix for
90, diag (-) denotes an operator that takes an n x 1 vector
and creates the corresponding n x n diagonal matrix with the
vector elements along the diagonal.
The topology data is crucial for power system operation.
It determines the real-time AC power flow model. Assume V
denotes the nb x 1 complex voltage vector, such that V =
VL.B, where voltage angle and voltage magnitude, B and V
are both nb x 1 vectors. The AC power flow model for the
system can bewritten as
[ 1 [ A1' .�* 1
Sbus diag (V) . Yb';,s V*
where SJ and St are nbr x 1 "from" and "to" complex power
lfow vectors, respectively, Sbus is nb x 1 complex power
injection vector, * represents the conjugate of vector [9].
This model is used in the subsequent SE module. In AC
SE, the "from" and "to" power flow measurements and the
power injection measurements of buses with power injection
(generation and/or loads) are used to estimate the states. Therefore,
a correct topology information ensures the validity of SE
results. Once the line status data is altered by attacker, the
topology processor will export incorrect topology information,
and hence, lead to wrong estimation results.
B. State Estimation
Consider an nz x 1 vector z of nonlinear measurements
given as
z = h(x, 9) + e
where x = [B, VJT is the system state vector, and e is an
nz x 1 noise vector which is independent of x and is modeled
as Gaussian distributed with 0 mean and crr covariance such
that the measurement error covariance matrix is given byR =
diag( {crn : )' The function h(x, 9) is a vector of nonlinear
functions that1 describes the relationship between the system
states and measurements for a topology 9. Both the line status
data s and the measurements z are collected by the SCADA
system. The commonly obtainedmeasurements in the grid are
the active and reactive power oflws and bus injections.
We use weighted least-squares (WLS) AC SE to calculate
the B and V [10]. The objectiveof the estimation process is to
minimize the sum of the squares of the weighted deviations of
the estimated measurements from z. The states are solved as
a least square problem with the following objectivefunction
min J(x) = (h(x) - zfR-1(h(x) - z) ,
the solution to which satisfies
oJ(x)
g(x) = = HT(x) . R-1 . (h(x) - z) = 0
ox
where the system Jacobianmatrix H = &�) Ix=,i; and x is
the 2nb x 1 estimated state vectors. The WLS solution for this
nonlinear optimization problem can besolved iteratively.

where XZm-n),p is the value from X2 distribution tables
corresponding to a detection confidence with probabilityp (e.g.
95%) and m - n degrees of freedom.
If the threshold in (9) is violated, largest normalized
residual method is further used for baddata identification. The
identified badmeasurement is removed from the measurement
vector and the SE is repeated until no baddata is detected.
C. Bad Data Detection
Measurements collected bySCADA can contain errors, and
hence, undermine the accuracy of estimated states. Therefore,
baddata detector should beequipped with SE to detect faulty
measurements, and hence, protect SE from large errors. The
measurement residual vector is used to detect baddata, as
r = z - h(x, 9)
where r is the nz x 1 residual vector.
The X2-detector is utilized to detect baddata. The threshold
is determined bythe x2-test. To bypass the baddata detection,
the residuals should satisfy the following relationship
rTR-1r /'": X2(m-n),p
III. ATTACK MODEL
In an unobservablestate-preserving topology attack, the
attacker aims to maliciously change the system topology from
Q to a different "target" topology Q = {N, £} without
changing the states. In this paper, we only consider topology
attacks that perturb line connection [, to £; the attacks aiming
to split or merge buses are out of scope, i.e. , N remains
unchanged. We denfie the line with status data changed by
attacker as target line and the end buses of the target line as
target buses.
As stated in Section I, topology attacks can beof two types:
line-maintaining and line-removing. For a line-maintaining
attack, the attacker maliciously alters the line status data of
the target line and injects false data to make it appear that line
which is not in the original graph [, is now shown as active
in £; the opposite is achieved by a line-removing attack. To
launch a state-preserving topology attack, the attacker injects
nbr x 1 line status attack vector band nz x 1 measurement
attack vector a. The line status attack vector bhas entries bk E
{-1 , 0,1 } for k E {l, ...,nbr} such that bk = 1, -1, and 0,
correspond to line-maintaining, line-removing and no attack
cases, respectively. This attack modifies (s, z) for topology Q
to (8", z) for topology Q such that
In the absence of noise, the attack vector satisfies
"8 = s + b, and z = z+ a.
a = h(x,Q) - h (x,Q) .
For a cyber-basedtopology attack considered here, when
the states are preserved, i.e. , unchanged, and the system
topology except for the target line remains the same, the
attacker needs to change the power flow of the target line. To
achieve this, the attacker only needs to change the power flow
measurements on the target line and power injection measurements
on the target buses to make such attack unobservable.
A. Line-removing vs. Line-maintaining attacks
For line-removing attack, as stated in [5], when the attacker
sets the target line status to zero, the "from" and "to" power
lfow measurements should also be changed to zero. The
modified power injection measurements for bus i are
Pt = P i -P ij
Qf = Qi -Qij
where P ij andQij are the physical active and reactive "from"
power flows of line ij, respectively. The modified power
injection measurements on bus j obey (12), as well. An
example of such attack is shown in Fig. l(a). In this case,
to create a precise attack, the line flow P ij and Qij have
to beestimated using all the relevant SCADA measurements.
A heuristic way to creating such attacks is to use just the
local power oflw measurements at bothends of the target line.
This is proposed in [5] and the authors have demonstrated its
performance via simulation.
In contrast, we argue that for a line-maintaining attack,
such a heuristic will not work. This is because for a linemaintaining
attack, the actual "from" and "to" power flows
on the target line are already zero since the target line is out.
(10)
(11)
(12)
W hen the attacker sets the target line status to 1, the "from"
and "to" power flow measurements should benon-zero since
the line appears active at control center. The modiefid "from"
power oflw measurements PIj and Qij should satisfy
Pi J = V? (gsi+ 9ij) - ViVj( gijCOS(ei - ej)
+bijsin(ei - ej))
Qij = -V? (bsi+ bij) - ViVj(9 ijsin(ei - ej)
-bijcoS(ei - ej))
where bij and gij are the susceptance and conductance of the
target line, respectively, bsi and gsi are the shunt branchsusceptance
and conductance of bus i, respectively. The modified
"to" power flow measurements Pj and Qji also obey (13).
From (13), we can see that to calculate the false power oflw
measurements on the target line, the attacker needs to estimate
the states. For the power injection measurements for bus i,
since the power injection for bus i should equal to the sum of
all line power flows from bus i, the measurements should be
modified as
Pt = P i+PiJ
Qi = Qi+Qij
where P i and Qi are the physical active and reactive power
injectionmeasurements, respectively; Pi a andQi are the injection
measurements modified byattacker. The power injection
measurements on bus j also satisfy the relationship in (14).
An example of such an attack is shown in Fig. l(b).

of the topology Q of the
For the system, we assume that the power system is observable
prior to the attack.
For nonlinear measurement model and AC SE, the attacker
cannot construct a only with the knowledge of system configuration.
In fact, recent work in [3], [4] show that attack vector
constructed with DC measurement model can bedetected when
the system uses AC SE. To this end, we model a sophisticated
attacker who attacks the line status data and measurements of
the target line and the power injection measurements on the
end buses of target line (target buses) by first estimating the
system states xsfor 5 using AC SE. Let IT represent the set
of measurements the attacker needs to modify to launch an
attack. The resulting modified measurement vector z input to
SE has entries
_ Zi,
Zi= {
hi(xs, Q) ,
(15)
For line-maintaining attacks, equations (13)-(14) imply
that the voltage magnitudes and voltage angle difference of
the target buses are required to form the unobservableattack
vector. Thus, the attacker has to obtaina good estimate of the
voltage magnitudes and voltage angle diefrence of the target
buses. Since the target line is physically disconnected, the
attacker needs to find a sub-network of the physical system to
estimate states on the target buses. Such a sub-network should
contain at least one physical path that connects the two target
buses. By using power oflw measurements on the lines of the
path, attacker can estimate the voltage magnitudes and voltage
angle differences of the buses on the path, and thus, obtain a
good estimate of the states of the target buses. For clarification,
consider the example shown in Fig. 2. In this case, the target
line is the line connecting bus 1 and 2. The goal of attacker
is to obtaina good estimate of states on target buses 1 and 2.
Assume bus1 is the reference bus. Attacker can use power flow
measurements on the line connecting bus 1 and 4 to calculate
V4 and!':, 814 = 81 - 84. Then, the V3 and!':, 843 = 84 - 83
can be estimated with power flow measurements on the line
connecting bus4 and 3 and the estimated V4L84. It is the same
for estimation of V2 and!':, 832 = 83 - 82. Then, attacker can
obtain a good estimation of voltage magnitudes VI and V2,
and voltage angle differenc!':,e 812 =!':, 814+!':, 843+!':, 832,
and hence, calculate the modified measurements.
Fig. 2. Illustration of a sub-network forunobservable state-preserving attack
For a specific target line, there are multiple paths between
the two target buses in the system. To reduce the cost of
attacks, attacker needs to analyze the system topology 9 and
ifnd the shortest path between the two target buses. Thus,
the attack can be launched by estimating a minimal set of
measurements.
We use a BFS algorithm to identify the shortest path
that connects the target buses. The minimal observation subnetwork
5 denotes the connectivity of the buses and lines on
1)
2)
3)

the shortest path. The physical power grid 9 is represented as
an unweighted and undirected graph in which an edge is a line
and a node is a bus. We assign one of the target buses as the
starting bus and the remaining target bus is the destination
bus. The procedure to determine 5 is as follows:
Algorithm 1 BFS for shortest path connecting target buses
Input: g, starting bus, destination bus
Output: shortest path connecting the starting bus and the
destination
Set the starting bus as the in progress bus and the rest
buses as unvisited buses. Set the level of the current
set of in pgroress buses as k = O.
Search all unvisited buses that are connected (by a
branch) to the set of in progress buses. Mark such
unvisited buses as the in progress buses and the
previous set of in pgroress buses as visited buses.
Set the level of the current set of in progress buses
as k = k + 1. If the destination bus is in the set of in
progress buses, that means the shortest path tree has
beenidentified, go to step 3. Otherwise, repeat step
2.
Backtrack from the desination bus to the starting bus
level-by-Ievel,and identify the shortest path. If there
is more than one shortest path, repeat step 3 until all
shortest paths are identified.
Once 5 is found, the attacker can assign one of the
target buses as a slack bus, collect and use the power oflw
measurements Zsfor all buses and lines in 5 to perform local
SE to minimize the estimate error as:
Js(xs) = (h(xs,5) - zsfRsl(h(xs,5) - zs),
(16)
for which the solution is
g(xA s) = JfJ( xs) = HT(xA s)·Rs1·(h(xs,5)-zs)= 0 (17)
Jf xs
where H = fJh1:s,S) s Ix=sxs is the system Jacobian matrix.
The WLS solution for this nonlinear optimization problemcan
besolved iteratively. Then attacker can calculate the modified
measurements with (15).
Since the power system is a complex geographically distributed
network, attacker may be limited to a subset of the
network static topology. Under such conditions, this method
can also be applied to find the minimal observation subnetwork.
Inpractice, to launch an unobservablestate-preserving linemaintaining
attack, attackers are limited to finite sets of target
lines due to the following reasons:
The power injection measurements can only be altered
byredistributing loads in cyberlayer. Attacker
cannot change generator output data due to direct
communication between control center and power
plant.
The power injection for no load buses cannot be
altered, since load occurring in no load buses can
beilmnediately detected byoperator.
Any attacks that can lead to negative loads in cyber
layer can bedetected.
The significant alteration of the system such as
system dividing to several islands (line-removing
attack) or islands combiningto a whole system (linemaintaining
attack) can lead to operator's intervention.
Therefore, to launch a successful line-maintaining attack, attacker
should analyze the system topology and operation states
prudently to choose a target line. The following three classes
of lines should beavoided as target lines:
Single critical line or critical pairs of lines.
Lines that once beingattacked can lead to negative
loads in cyberlayer.
Lines that connected to no load buses.
In Section V, we illustrate the attack design and the algorithm
performance with an IEEE 24-bus reliable test system (RTS).

NUMERICALRESULTS
In this section, we use the IEEE 24-bus RTS shown in Fig.
3 as the test system. We assume that the measurements in the
test system are: (a) active and reactive power flows on both
ends of all lines; and (b) active and reactive power injection
on buses with loads and/or generation; i.e. , overall, the number
of total measurements in the test system is 192. We run our
simulations with MATLAB R2014a and MATPOWER 4.1.

B. Minimal Observation Sub-network
In this subsection, we exhaustively illustrate the minimal
observation sub-network of each feasibletarget line according
to the algorithm introduced in Section IV. The details of
each minimal observation sub-network for each target line are
demonstrated in TABLE II. The minimal numberof lines and
buses (denote as nSl and nSb, respectively) inside the minimal
observation sub-network for each target line is illustrated in
Fig. 4. That is the minimal information the attacker needs to
observe beforelaunching a successful attack. Since the system
is under full monitoring redundancy, there are 4 measurements
which are active and reactive power flow measurements on
both "from" and "to" ends placing on a line. Therefore, the
minimum number measurements the attacker needs to access
is the minimum number of observation measurements along
the path, as well as the measurements placed on the target line
and the target buses, i.e. , 4nsl + 8.

A. Feasible Target Line Selection
In this subsection, we analyze the test system to identify
all feasible target lines for unobservablestate-preserving linemaintaining
attacks. We first exclude critical lines and the lines
that connected to a no load buses in the system. For the rest
lines, we perfonn a whole network SE and use the estimated
states to calculate the attack vector. We check the modiefid
loads in cyber layer for each line and exclude the lines that
can lead to negative loads. TABLE I demonstrates all the lines
we exclude from the set of feasibletarget lines and the reason
for exclusion. Overall, for line-maintaining attacks, there are
8 feasible target lines in the test system, for which the line
indices are #2, #5, #8, #9, #12, #13, #34, #35.
From these results, we can see that the minimal observation
sub-network for each target line is relatively small compared
with the whole network topology even for a small system such
as IEEE 24-bus RTS. The largest minimal observation subnetwork
in the test system consists of 4 branches and 5 buses,
in which the total observation measurements number is 16.
The numberof measurements of this sub-network that attacker
need to access inside is 24, which is 12.5% of the test system.
Therefore, it is possible for attacker to launch such attacks
with only a small subset of information of the system.

We test 1000 trials for each target line with two attack

While the

CO NCLUSION A ND FUTUREWORK
In this paper, we focus on unobservablestate-preserving
topology attacks,
especially the line-maintaining attacks.
We
propose an algorithm
based on BFS to nfid
the
minimum
local information required to perform such attacks.
We have
shown that our proposed algorithm can enablean attacker
to
obtainthe localized topology and corresponding measurement
data to mount an attack that bypasses bad data detector and
successfully changes topology information of the system in the
cyberlayer.
One possible extension is to study a more sophisticated
class of topology attacks
in which both topology information
and system
states are changed byattacker
in an unobservable
manner. Moreover, we will also study the consequences of
topology attacks
on physical power system. It is crucial to
identify the anomalies caused bysuch unobservabletopology
attacks
in modules subsequent to SE, and thereby, develop the
detection
modules and resiliency mechanisms to detect and
mitigate such topology attacks.
