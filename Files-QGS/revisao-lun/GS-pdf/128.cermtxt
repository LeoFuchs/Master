ABSTRACT
State estimation is a very critical component in smart grid, a typical energy-based cyber-physical system. Kalman filter
has been widely used in the dynamic state estimation of power systems. Although a large number of research efforts have
been made on the robustness and filtering effectiveness, little effort has been conducted on cyber attacks against Kalman
filtering. To address this issue, in this paper we systematically compare three representative Kalman filtering techniques
and formalize the problem of anomaly detection against false data injection attacks in Kalman filter. On the basis of our
modeling results, we investigate five novel attack approaches that can bypass the anomaly detection. To defend against
those attacks, we develop two countermeasures: the enhancement of Kalman filtering and the temporal-based detection
algorithm. We conduct extensive performance evaluation and our data validates our theoretical finding well. Copyright ©

1. INTRODUCTION
Smart grid is a typical cyber physical system (CPS) [1,2]
which integrates a physical power transmission system
with the cyber process of network computing and communication.
It supplies electric power from generators
through power transmission and distribution networks to
large geographical areas. In a power grid, supervisory control
and data acquisition (SCADA) systems collect the real
time information of power field and report the collected
information to the control center. To provide reliable and
secured electricity service operations, real-time monitoring
is essential for both system operators and customers,
as it provides rich and pertinent information on the condition
of a power-grid based on the measurements of meters
deployed at critical locations of power grid.
State estimation is a very critical component in smart
grids that monitor and control the grid operation. The traditional
state estimation mainly reflects the static state
characteristics of power systems, denoted as the static state
estimation. The static state estimation uses telemetered
data from the supervisory control and data acquisition system
per several seconds and applies the weighted least

squares (WLS) to obtain the best fit estimation of static
state variables, for example, bus voltage magnitudes and
phase angles. One shortcoming of these static estimation
techniques is the accuracy, posing the missing detection
of abnormal behaviors. Differently, dynamic state estimation
can obtain complete, coherent, and real-time dynamic
states, including the generator speeds, rotor angles,
and others.
Kalman filtering techniques have been widely used in
the dynamic state estimation of power systems. The traditional
state estimation of power systems is based on the
steady system state model [3] that only reflects static states.
With Kalman filtering, the dynamic state estimation can be
used to dynamically predict system states and control the
system. Kalman filter can not only provide the prediction
through the dynamic system model and previous estimation
of system states but also obtain the optimal estimate
of power systems through meter measurements deployed
in the field. In particular, measurements can be conducted
through phasor measurement units (PMU) and processed
by the dynamic state estimator to filter measurement noise
and detect gross errors. The output of dynamic state estimation
can be used by other grid applications at the control

center, including the contingency analysis, optimal power
flow, economic dispatch, and others [4].
The dynamic state estimation was initially developed in
1970s [5] when Kalman filtering was applied to improve
the computational performance of steady state estimation
in power systems. After that, a number of techniques to
conduct the dynamic state estimation in power systems
have been developed [3,6-14]. In particular, the linear
extended Kalman filter (EKF) [10] is a popular one that
provides the optimal state estimation for power systems.
However, once the system is encountered, measurement
errors or large load changes, the performance of EKF
could decline noticeably. To overcome this limitation,
the enhanced EKF [15] and M-estimation and unscented
Kalman filter (UKF) [12] were proposed to incorporate
with nonlinear measurement functions. We would like to
point out that although a number of research efforts have
been made on improving the performance of Kalman filtering
such as robustness to deal with random noise [15],
little effort has been conducted on cyber attacks such as
false data injection attacks against Kalman filtering.
To address this issue, in this paper we investigate
false data injection attacks against Kalman filtering in the
dynamic state estimation of power systems and develop
countermeasures to defend against those attacks. Note
that the adversary can inject false measurement reports
to the controller through compromised nodes and disrupt
system operation. Those attacks that are generally denoted
as false data injection threats could pose dangerous threats
to the smart grid. To this end, we first review and compare
several representative Kalman filter techniques and
formalize the anomaly detection problem in the Kalman
filter. Based on our modeling results, we then investigate
five attack approaches that can bypass the anomaly
detection. In addition, we discuss the impact of false
data injection attacks on other key functional modules of
smart grid.
We conduct extensive experiments on IEEE 14-bus,
30-bus, and 118-bus systems to validate the effectiveness
of our investigated attacks. Our data shows that our proposed
attacks can effectively reduce the performance of
Kalman filtering. To mitigate such attacks, we develop
two defensive mechanisms: one is enhancing UKF technique
to improve the resilience of Kalman filter, and the
other is adopting the temporal-based detection algorithm.
We implement our proposed countermeasures on IEEE
14-bus, 30-bus, and 118-bus systems. Our experimental
data shows that the enhanced UKF technique achieves the
best performance than other Kalman filtering techniques to
deal with random benign noise and reduce the impact of
attacks to some extent. Our experimental data show that
our temporal-based detection can identify compromised
meters accurately and quickly.
To the best of our knowledge, our research is the first
on studying the impact of false data injection attacks
on Kalman filtering in the dynamic state estimation of
power systems. The remainder of this paper is organized
as follows: In Section 2, we review the related work. In
834
Section 3, we briefly discuss smart grid and state estimation
and introduce threat model. In Section 4, we review
and compare the three representative Kalman filtering techniques.
In Section 5, we formalize the anomaly detection
problem in the Kalman filter and investigate five attack
approaches that can bypass the anomaly detection. In
Section 6, we analyze the deviation of state estimation
under these attacks. In Section 7, we develop two countermeasures
against false data injection attacks. In Section 8,
we show the experimental results of those attacks and
corresponding countermeasures. Finally, we conclude the
paper in Section 9.
2. RELATED
WORK
We now briefly review some of the research efforts related
to our study, including the smart grid security, cyber
attacks against state estimation, and Kalman filter techniques.
With the development of the smart grid, a number
of efforts have been paid on the cyber security of smart
grid [16-19]. For example, Teixeira et al. [16] analyzed the
cyber security of state estimators in SCADA system operation
in power grids and proposed the stealthy deception
attacks under perturbed linear and nonlinear estimators
and developed a protection tool against such attacks in
SCADA. Xie et al. [19] analyzed the potential financial
misconduct in electricity markets under false data injection
attacks against the state estimation in deregulated
electricity markets.
State estimation is a very critical component in smart
grid, which monitors and controls the smart grid operation
in desired states. In the recent past, there are some
research efforts on false data injection attacks against the
static state estimation in power systems. For example, Liu
et al. [20] showed that the adversary with the knowledge
of grid system configuration can bypass the traditional
bad data detection and identification algorithms so that the
results of static state estimation can be manipulated. Using
the developed attack schemes, the adversary can construct
the attack vector and change the results of static state estimation
arbitrarily. After this work, a number of research
efforts have been conducted to study the false data injection
attacks against power system static state estimation
and countermeasures [18,19,21-24].
Different from the static state estimation, the dynamic
state estimation can obtain complete, coherent, and realtime
dynamic states such as generator speeds, rotor angles,
and others. In the past, a number of research efforts have
been conducted to improve the performance of dynamic
state estimate in power systems [10-12,15]. Note that
Kalman filtering techniques were initially proposed to use
for the dynamic state estimation by Debs et al. [5]. After
that, a number of research efforts have been conducted to
improve its performance in power systems to conduct the
dynamic state estimation [10-12,15]. For example, based
on the EKF technique, Mandal et al. [11] proposed two
algorithms for conducting the dynamic state estimation

that incorporate the nonlinearity of measurement functions
in the EKF technique. Shih et al. [15] proposed
an improved technique using the exponential function to
increase the robustness of the EKF technique. Valverde
et al. [12] introduced the UKF technique to deal with a
highly nonlinear model of network equations in power systems.
Ghahremani et al. [10] developed an EKF technique
for dynamic state estimation for a synchronous machine by
using PMU quantities and proposed an EKF with unknown
inputs to identify and estimate the states and unknown
inputs of the synchronous machine simultaneously.
Although a number of research efforts have been conducted
on improving the performance of the Kalman filtering,
little effort has been conducted on cyber attacks
against Kalman filtering in the dynamic state estimation of
power systems. Different from the existing research efforts,
our research is the first on studying the impact of false data
injection attacks on the performance of Kalman filtering in
the dynamic state estimation of power systems.
3. PRELIMINARIES
In this section, we first introduce the smart grid and discuss
dynamic state estimation. After that, we introduce the
attack model.
3.1. Smart grid
The smart grid is a completely modernized electricity
delivery system that uses modern information, communications,
and control technology to detect, protect and
optimize the operation of interconnected elements. Smart
grid is designed to improve the electric system's reliability,
security, and efficiency through the two-way communication
of both electricity and information [25]. To transform
the existing power grid to the one that functions more
intelligently, the smart grid not only takes advantage of
modern communication and sensing/measurement technologies
but also incorporates renewable energy resources.
For example, to improve the electricity distribution and
management, the modern measurement technologies such
as PMUs are considered. To provide better situation awareness
of the grid, PMUs can collect 30 to 60 data points
per second, whereas the traditional SCADA systems collect
one data point per second. Through the aid of communication,
signal processing, control, and computation
technologies, the smart grid enables the power grid to
be smarter.
3.2. State estimation
State estimation has been widely used by the energy management
systems (EMS) to monitor and control the power
grid and make it operate in desired states. State estimation
plays an important role in the monitoring and controlling
of the grid. As the input of other modules, the results of
Security Comm. Networks 2016; 9:833-849 © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
DOI: 10.1002/sec
state estimation can affect the grid operation significantly.
For example, on August 14, 2003, the power grid failure
in northeastern America resulted in the largest blackout
in history, affecting around 50 million people in major
US and Canadian cities, including New York, Cleveland,
Detroit, Toronto, and Ottawa [26]. The direct reason of
this accident is that bushes beneath the 345-KV line fired,
leading to line short-circuit disconnection. The other main
reason of this power outage is due to an error in state estimation
in the regional grid dispatch center. The dispatcher
could not recognize the short circuit of the line and the
error led to a series of chain reactions and expanded the
affect of accident.
Another example is the Portugal blackout on May
10, 2000 [27]. A stork's nest tangled in power lines
was thought plunged Lisbon and the southern half of
Portugal into darkness. In this accident, because of the
error in state estimation at the control center, the automatic
protection system at a major substation in Rio Maior,
50 miles north of Lisbon, did not function and the short
circuit led to a domino effect that knocked out other
substations further south.
3.3. Attack model
The smart grid is under the serious risk of cyber attacks
because of its dependence on cyber infrastructure [28]. An
adversary may launch cyber attacks by compromising the
meter or sensor and hacking the communication networks
in the smart grid [20,29-31]. For example, the Stuxnet
worm found in July 2010 that targeted the SCADA system
in the process control system raises new questions about
power grid security [32].
We assume that the measurements of power systems are
conducted through a sensor network that consists of m sensors
with a measurement vector yk = {yk,1, , yk,m}. Here
yk,i is the measurement from sensor i at time k. All sensors
should have a range that defines the bound of yi for all
k. That is, all sensors have minimum and maximum values
8k, yk,i 2 yimin, yimax . Let i = yimin, yimax . We assume
the sensor measurement yk,i is bounded by i.
Denote z(k) 2 Rp as received measurements at the state
estimator at time k. Based on these measurements, the state
estimator approximates the power system states. If some
of the sensors are under attack, z(k) may be different from
the real measurement yk. We assume that the element in
received measurement zk,i is bounded by i. Note that
signals beyond this bound can be easily detected.
Denote Ka = {Kb, , Ks} as the attack duration that
begins with the time of Kb and ends at the time of Ks.
A general model for received measurements is defined by
the following:
zk,i =
8< yk,i
for k … Ka
: yk,i + ck,i for k 2 Ka, yk,i + ck,i 2 i

where ck,i is the attack signal. This generic attack model
can be used to represent false data injection attacks in
this paper. In terms of false data injection attacks, we
assume that if adversaries compromise sensors, they can
inject arbitrary values that can bypass the detection by the
anomaly detection algorithms. Hence, ck,i is an arbitrary
nonzero value.
4. KALMAN FILTERING
TECHNIQUES
In this section, we review and compare the three representative
Kalman filtering techniques, including the EKF [10],
the UKF [12], and the enhanced EKF [15]. The notations
in this paper are listed in Table I.
4.1. Extended Kalman filter technique and
enhanced extended Kalman filter technique
In the following, we first review the EKF technique [10]
and then review the enhanced EKF technique [15,33].
4.1.1. Extended Kalman filter technique.
The EKF technique [10] considers both incoming measurements
and predicted states to obtain the optimal estimates
of system states. The EKF technique consists of
a two-stage recursive process of prediction and filtering.
The state equations and measurement equations in power
systems are as follows
xk = f (xk-1, uk-1, wk-1)
zk = h(xk, uk, vk)
(2)
836
where zk and xk are the measurable output and state variable
vector at time k (subscript k represents time slots),
respectively, uk is the measurable input, wk-1 the process
(state) noise, vk the measurement noise, f the system
function, and h the output function. Assume that measurements
from PMU use the discrete sampling time instant k.
The noise sequences vk and wk are supposed to be white
Gaussian and independent with a zero mean and covariance
matrices Rk and Qk, respectively. Here Qk and Rk
are model error variance and measurement error variance,
respectively. With the knowledge of the power system
model, steps in EKF algorithm can be listed as follows:
Step 1: prediction step.
( xOk- = f xOk+-1, uk-1, 0
Pk- = Fk-1Pk-1FkT-1 + Lk-1Qk-1LkT-1
+
where Fk-1 =
xOk+-1, uk-1, 0 .
Step 2: Filtering step.
@@xf xOk+-1, uk-1, 0 and Lk-1 =
8ˆ Kk = P-HT HkPk-HkT + MkRkMkT -1
ˆ k k
< Ok+ = xOk- + Kk yk - h xOk-, 0

ˆ
ˆ: Pk+ = (I - KkHk)Pkwhere
Hk = @h xOk-, uk, 0 and Mk = @h xOk-, uk, 0 . The
@x @v
detailed description of EKF algorithm can be found in [34].
The EKF technique is effective and applicable to linear
systems. We can approximate the power system through
a linear system in the normal operation condition. Then
EKF technique is applied to achieve an accurate prediction.
Nevertheless, EKF technique ignores the nonlinearity
of measurement functions. When the system load or generator
output power mutates, ignoring the second-order and
higher order terms can have impact on the accuracy of
estimation. In addition, the distribution of the power system
state may not follow the Gaussian distribution and
the EKF technique can incur errors as it assumes that the
distribution of states follows the Gaussian distribution.
4.1.2. Enhanced extended Kalman
filter technique.
The enhanced EKF technique [15,33] incorporates the
nonlinearity of the measurement function and embeds
the exponential weight function in the filtering process.
The enhanced EKF technique consists of the following
two steps: prediction and filtering. The state equation
in the enhanced EKF is linear, different from the linear
state equation in EKF. The form of prediction step in the
enhanced EKF is the same as it in EKF. In the filtering step,
it formulates an objective function, replaces Wk (Wk representing
kth diagonal element in the diagonal matrix W and
W is the diagonal matrix of weighting factors for each measurement)
by Wk exp - ˇˇzk - h xOk- ˇˇ , and minimizes the

objective function in terms of the state vector. After that,
it then uses the Taylor series to expand h(xO+) in term of xOwhile
ignoring the high-order terms. Hence, we can take
the second-order term into account [33] and the nonlinearity
of measurement function can be well incorporated.
After that, the result can be substituted into the derivative
of objective function and the results of filtering step can
be obtained.
The enhanced EKF technique can effectively improve
the performance and robustness in comparison with the
EKF technique. First, it improves the performance by
incorporating the nonlinearity of measurement functions,
especially when sudden large load and/or generation
changes occur [11]. Second, the enhanced EKF technique
replaces the weight function of W by W exp(-|z - h(x)|).
Once a raw measurement encounters a significant deviation
that results in the increase of absolute residual vector,
the inversion of absolute of residual vector can suppress
the impact. In this way, the estimation performance can
be maintained.
4.2. Unscented Kalman filter technique
The UKF technique [12] is based on the application of the
unscented transformation along with the Kalman filter. The
state equations and measurement equations in the power
system are the following:
( xk = f (xk-1, k - 1) + qk-1
zk = h(xk, k) + rk
where zk and xk are the measurable output and state variable
vector at time k, respectively, qk-1 and rk are the
system noise and measurement Gaussian noise, with zero
mean and uncorrelated covariance matrices Q and R. Note
that functions f and h are nonlinear equations that represent
the system and measurements models in terms of the
state variables and other system inputs. The UKF technique
consists of the following three steps:
Step 1: sigma points calculation. It creates a set of 2n +
1 sigma points by using the state vector x at time k - 1
and the corresponding covariance matrix Pk-1

where c = n + , = ˛2(n + ) - n, and = 0. For
the purpose of the estimation initialization (i.e., when
k = 0), the initial state vector and the initial covariance
matrix have to be defined in advance according to a
priori knowledge of the system.
Step 2: Kalman filter state prediction. It evaluates the
set of sigma points computed in step 1 through the

XO ki = f Xki-1, k - 1 i = 0, : : : , 2n
(7)
where Xki-1 is the (i + 1)th column of matrix Xk-1 and
XO ki is a n (2n + 1) matrix that contains the propagated
sigma points. Next, it computes the predicted state
mean vector xOk- and the predicted covariance matrix Pkas
follows:
ˆ<8 xOk- = Pi2=n0 WimXO ki

where W0m = n+ , W0c = n+
2(n1+ ) , and Wic = 2(n1+ ) .
Step 3: Kalman filter state correction. It calculates the
sigma points corresponding to the mean vector and
covariance matrix of the predicted state. We have

In the UKF technique, the nonlinear equations are not
linearized as the EKF technique does. Differently, the
statistical distribution of states is propagated through nonlinear
equations. Hence, it can provide a better estimate
of actual states and the posterior covariance matrix. In

addition, the UKF technique can improve the convergence
speed and the robustness [12].
The comparison of those three Kalman filtering techniques
is summarized in Table II. Note that the detailed
evaluation of filtering capacity and time complexity can be
found in Tables III and IV in Section 8, and the detailed
evaluation of robustness can be found in Figures 6, 7, 8,
and 9 in Section 8, which show the results of performance
index under false data injection attacks. For the observation
of Jacobian matrix, we can simply obtain through
the principle of Kalman filtering techniques described
previously.
5. ATTACK APPROACHES
In this section, we first formalize the anomaly detection in
the Kalman filter and then represent five attacks to bypass
the anomaly detection, followed by the discussion of
those attacks.
5.1. Anomaly detection in Kalman filter
On the basis of the principle of the EKF technique in
Section 4.1, we can see that the predicted state vector can
be obtained after the step of prediction. From the predicted
838

state vector, system measurements can be predicted and
an innovation vector defined as the difference between the
actual and predicted measurements can be determined. The
innovation vector v can be derived by the following:
vk = yk - h xOk-, 0
where yk is the original measurement vector, h xOk-, 0 is
the predicted measurements, and xOk- is the predicted state.
Note that v can be approximated by a white Gaussian
process.
The benefit of using an innovation vector for time k
is helping to identify the presence of anomalies through
the normalized innovation vector k. For the ith measurement,
the normalized innovation process [36] in the EKF
technique is as follows:
k,i = vk,i/ k,i
i = 1, 2,
, m
k2,i = Hk,iPk-HkT,i + Mk,iRkMkT,i,
i = 1, 2,
, m (17)
<k = HkPk-HkT + MkRkMkT
where Hk = @h xO k-, 0 and Mk = @h xOk-, 0 , vk,i is the
@x @v
ith component of vk, Hk,i and Mk,i is the ith row of Hk
and Mk, respectively; Pk- is the error covariance matrix of
prediction step, R is the error covariance matrix of measurement.
When the anomaly exists, the hypothesis | k,i|
max 8i(i 2 m) will not hold. Note that the selection of
max is based on the diagonal entries of <k.
Figure 1 illustrates the workflow of anomaly detection.
As we can see that once the anomaly is detected, the next
step is to identify three abnormalities (e.g., occurrence of
bad data, sudden variation of states, and changes in network
configuration) and take the corresponding action. If
the first step in the anomaly detection can be bypassed (i.e.,
if | k,i| max 8i(i 2 m)), the anomaly detection algorithm
cannot issue alert and Kalman filter can continue to

execute. The detailed steps of anomaly detection algorithm
is shown in Algorithm 1.

For UKF and enhanced EKF techniques, because the
structure of these two techniques is similar to the EKF
technique, the innovation vector and the normalized innovation
vector can be derived in the same way as the one
in EKF technique, except that in UKF technique, the <k

5.2. Novel attack approaches bypassing
anomaly detection
Recall that the anomaly detection algorithm is based on
| k,i| max 8i(i 2 m). When sophisticated false data
injection attacks are used, the adversary can attack the
power system effectively with the non-zero attack vector
ck. From the anomaly detection algorithm, we have
ˇ zk,i - hi xOk-, 0 ˇˇ
ˇ
ˇˇˇ k,i ˇˇˇ
max
(20)
where hi xOk-, 0 is the ith element of h xOk-, 0 , and zk,i is
the malicious measurements. We obtain the range of zk,i by
hi xOk-, 0 + max k,i
zk,i
hi xOk-, 0 - max k,i (21)
Security Comm. Networks 2016; 9:833-849 © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
DOI: 10.1002/sec
That is, the malicious measurement zk,i can be a value
within the limitation and the attack vector is ck = zk - yk.
In addition, every malicious measurement can approach its
threshold at the same time. On the other hand, max, k,i
and hi xOk-, 0 can be derived between time k - 1 and k. That
is, the range of malicious measurement zk,i can be acquired
before time k, which will pose a great threat to the estimate
at time k.
We assume that the adversary knows about the anomaly
detection algorithm that relies on | k,i| max 8i(i 2 m).
The adversary has the knowledge, including the exact nonlinear
model that is used (i.e., f and h), parameters (Q
and R), state estimation xO, error covariance matrix P and
original measurements y. In the following, we present five
attack approaches in detail.
5.2.1. Maximum magnitude-based attack.
In a maximum magnitude-based attack, the adversary
tends to achieve the maximum deviation of original measurements
that equals to the maximum magnitude of the
attack vector |ck,i|. To achieve this goal, the received measurement
zk,i should be manipulated furthest from the
original measurement yk,i after adding the false data. To be
drifted from the original measurement yk,i, zk,i should be
as follows:
zk,i =
( hi xOk-, 0 - max k,i if vk,i
0
hi xOk-, 0 + max k,i if vk,i < 0
Based on Equation (15), the attack vector ck can be
derived by the following:
We have
|ck,i| = |zk,i - yk,i| =
max k,i + |vk,i|
Then, the magnitude of attack vector |ck,i| is maximum.
The detailed steps of maximum magnitude-based attack
is shown in Figure 2. As we can see, after we acquire
the power system parameters such as the model, the current
estimation and error covariance matrix at time k - 1,
we compute the predicted measurements hi, max and k,i
at time k. Then for the next time step when the original
measurement yk,i is received at time k, the innovation vector
vk,i is computed and the decision of vk,i 0 can be
determined. If it holds, the adversary would manipulate
the received measurement zk,i and makes it hi - max k,i
at time k. Otherwise, the adversary would manipulate the
received measurement zk,i and make it hi + max k,i. Then,
the power system state at time k is obtained using the
received measurements. If the adversary wants to continue
the attack, the above process repeats over different times.
(19)
ck,i = zk,i - yk,i =
-vk,i - max k,i if vk,i 0
-vk,i + max k,i if vk,i < 0

5.2.2. Wave-based attack.
Opposite to the maximum magnitude-based attack, in
the wave-based attack, regardless of whether vk,i is positive
or negative, the malicious measurements zk,i will be the
reverse direction of injected attack data at time k - 1.
To this end, zk,i is as follows:
zk,i =
( hi xOk-, 0 - max k,i if vk,i < 0
hi xOk-, 0 + max k,i if vk,i
0
The attack vector ck is as follows:
ck,i = zk,i - yk,i =
-vk,i - max k,i if vk,i < 0
-vk,i + max k,i if vk,i 0
(25)
(26)
Then, the absolute value of the element in attack vector
ck is as follows:
|ck,i| = |zk,i - yk,i| =
max k,i - |vk,i|
(27)
The detailed steps of wave-based attack is the same as
the one in the maximum magnitude-based attack, except
840
that if vk,i < 0, the received measurement will be set to
hi - max k,i; otherwise, the received measurement will be
set to hi + max k,i.
5.2.3. Positive deviation attack.
In the positive deviation attack, the adversary tends to
achieve the maximum deviation of original measurements
along with the direction of increase; that is, the malicious
measurements zk,i are always maximum in the range of its
value. Positive deviation attack can be described as
zk,i = hi xOk-, 0 + max k,i
The attack vector ck is as follows:
ck,i = zk,i - yk,i = -vk,i + max k,i
The absolute value of the element in the attack vector
ck is as follows:
|ck,i| = |zk,i - yk,i| =
max k,i - vk,i

Figure 3. Workflow of positive deviation attack.
The detailed steps of positive deviation attack is shown
in Figure 3.
5.2.4. Negative deviation attack.
In the negative deviation attack, the adversary tends to
achieve the maximum deviation of original measurements
along with the direction of decrease, that is, the malicious
measurements zk,i are always minimum in the range of its
value. In the negative deviation attack, zk,i should be
zk,i = hi xOk-, 0 - max k,i
The attack vector ck is as follows:
ck,i = zk,i - yk,i = -vk,i - max k,i
The absolute value of the element in the attack vector
ck is as follows:
(31)
(32)
|ck,i| = |zk,i - yk,i| =
max k,i + vk,i
(33)
The detailed steps in the negative deviation attack is the
same as the ones in the positive deviation attack, except
that the updated measurement will be set to hi - max k,i.
5.2.5. Mixed attacks.
On the basis of the four attacks described previously
as primitives, the adversary can develop other attacks by

DOI: 10.1002/sec

mixing those attack primitives. Taking the wave-based
attack and positive deviation attack as an example, the
adversary launches the wave-based attack at time k, the
positive deviation attack at time k + 1, the wave-based
attack again at time k + 2, and positive deviation attack
at time k + 3 and so on. In addition, we have other alternatives
such as negative/positive-mixed attack that mixes
the negative deviation attack and positive deviation attack,
wave/negative-mixed attack that mixes the wave-based
attack and negative deviation attack, wave/positive-mixed
attack that mixes the wave-based attack and positive deviation
attack, and so on.
5.3. Discussion
We now discuss the false data injection attacks on smart
grid. Note that results of state estimation have a great
impact on other modules in power grid, including the
contingency analysis (CA), optimal power flow (OPF,)
economic dispatch (ED), and others. State estimation and
other modules are shown in Figure 4. As we can see, PMUs
measure the output data of the power grid, SCADA collects
data and transfers it to the state estimator in EMS.
The state estimator can be either a static state estimator or
a dynamic state estimator. Note that he dynamic state estimator
consists of the dynamic state estimation algorithm
and the anomaly detection algorithm.
In the dynamic state estimator, the raw measurements
are first processed by the dynamic state estimation algorithm
to output state estimation. Then, the results of state
estimation can be processed by detection algorithm. In
detection algorithm, the model and data of power system
can be adapted if anomaly condition is detected, and the
adapted model and data will be returned to the dynamic
state estimation algorithm that conduct the estimate again.
If the anomaly condition does not occur, the state estimation
results of dynamic state estimation algorithm will be
used by other modules directly. Depending on outputs of
the state estimator, the BDDI module processes the raw
measurements on the basis of the estimated states and
determine whether raw measurements can be used or not.
841
On false data injection attacks
Q. Yang, L. Chang and W. Yu
The output of BDDI will be the input of modules such
as CA, OPF, and ED. After that, control decisions based
on the output of these modules will be reached. In other
words, if the result of state estimation is manipulated, it
incurs a great impact on other modules.
State estimation is used for the case in which we have
redundant equations for the system. Differently, power
flow control is used for handling the case in which we have
nonredundant equations. The power flow computation is
based on the measurements processed by BDDI. The measurements
after processing by BDDI will be the input for
the power flow computation. Note that power flow computation
is subject to the assumption that inputs is absolutely
accurate, and as a matter of fact it is impossible in realworld
practice. If the deviation of state estimation appears,
the measurement processed by BDDI can have a large
deviation from the true value, posing errors of power flow
computation as well.
State estimation can estimate the actual switching (or
connection) state in power grid based on remote measurements,
and correct the occasional error switch state
information to ensure the correctness of the power grid.
Contingency analysis uses the outputs of state estimation.
As an example, the power grid failure in northeastern
America [26] discussed in Section 3.2 is a typical case
in which the network topology analysis error in state
estimation leads to the error in contingency analysis.
Under the circumstance of guaranteing the safety and
high quality of power production and meeting customer
demand for electricity, the economic dispatch takes a variety
of techniques and management measures to ensure
power production equipments in a good condition and
transmission electricity power in the lowest cost. To this
end, the economic dispatch is a critical module in the
power grid. It tends to reduce line loss of power grid
and achieve the lowest cost of power generation or fuel
costs. The line loss also depends on the accuracy of state
estimation as its computation is based on bus voltage phasor
and bus current phasor as well. If state estimation is
manipulated, the computation of line loss can be misled
and the economic dispatch functional modules can then
be disrupted.
6. ANALYSIS OF STATE DEVIATION
In this section, we conduct the theoretical analysis of state
deviation caused by attacks. We first show our analysis on
the linear model of power system and then extend it to a
nonlinear model of power system.
6.1. State deviation in linear model
Taking the linear model into consideration, we have the
following:
xk = Fk-1xk-1 + Gk-1 + wk-1
zk = Hkxk + vk
(34)
842
(35)
(36)
(40)
(41)
Security Comm. Networks 2016; 9:833-849 © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
DOI: 10.1002/sec
where Fk-1 is an n-dimensional nonzero diagonal matrix,
Gk-1 is an n-dimensional column vector, wk-1 is a white
Gaussian sequence with zero mean and covariance matrix
Qk-1, Hk is an m-dimensional nonzero measurement
matrix, and vk is a white Gaussian measurement noise
error vector with zero mean and covariance matrix Rk. The
parameter matrix Fk-1 and Gk-1 can be identified online
by using a linear exponential smoothing technique for forecasting
[13]. We also assume that the adversary attacks the
power system between time k - 1 and k. At this time, we
have the prediction step listed in the later text.
( xOk- = Fk-1xOk-1 + Gk-1
+
Pk- = Fk-1Pk-1FkT-1 + Qk-1
+
Then the filtering step can be described as follows:
8 Kk = P-HT HkPk-HkT + Rk -1
<ˆ x k k Ok+
= xOk- + Kk zk - HkxOk
ˆ: Pk+ = (I - KkHk)PkNote
that the system parameters F, G, and H unchanged
continuously in this case. In addition, P-, P+ and K are
always unchanging due to the changeless of Pk+-1, so only
yk can be manipulated after being attacked, that is, the state
deviation that the adversary manipulates in the next step is
denoted as follows:
ak = Kkck
(37)
where ak is malicious errors that are added to the original
estimates xOk+ at time k, Kk is the Kalman gain at time k, ck
is the nonzero attack vector that the adversary adds to the
original sensor measurement vector yk at time k.
With the attack vector ck, the state at time k is
as follows:
xOk++ = xOk+ + ak (38)
where xOk++ is the state estimation after the attack is
launched. At the next time k + 1, we have the following:
xOk+++1 = Fk xOk++ + Gk + Kk+1 zk+1 - Hk+1 Fk xOk++ + Gk
(39)
where zk+1 is the received measurement at time k + 1 and
zk+1 = yk+1 + ck+1.
Then, we have the following:
zk+1 = yk+1 + ck+1
xOk+1 = Fk xOk+ +Gk +Kk+1 yk+1 - Hk+1 FkxOk+ + Gk
+
xOk+++1 = Fk xOk++ + Gk + Kk+1 zk+1 - Hk+1 Fk xOk++ + Gk
(42)
Substituting Equations (38), (40), and (41) into
Equation (42), we have the following:
xOk+++1 = xOk+1 + Kk+1ck+1 + (I - Kk+1Hk+1)Fkak
+
(43)
Q. Yang, L. Chang and W. Yu
That is,
ak+1 = Kk+1ck+1 + (I - Kk+1Hk+1)Fkak
Similarly, we have the following:
ak+2 = Kk+2ck+2 + (I - Kk+2Hk+2)Fk+1ak+1
and so on.
From the previous analysis, we conclude that when the
attack is launched between the time k - 1 and k, we can
obtain the state deviation ak = Kkck when the adversary
first launches the attack at time sample k, then the state
deviation can be changed in according to following:
ak+m = Kk+mck+m + (I - Kk+mHk+m)Fk+m-1ak+m-1 (46)
6.2. State deviation in nonlinear model
The linear model is useful in power system application.
However, the nonlinear model fits the actual power system
better. We now analyze the state deviation in the nonlinear
model of the power system. From the principle of EKF
techniques in Section 4.1, we have the following:
xOk+ = xOk- + Kk yk - h xOk-, 0
= f xOk+-1, 0 + Kk yk - h f xOk+-1, 0 , 0
= Kkyk + f xOk+-1, 0 - Kkh f xOk+-1, 0 , 0
We assume that the adversary attacks the power system
between time k - 1 and k. From the principle in Section 4.1,
we can see that system parameters Fk-1, Lk-1, Hk, and Mk
unchanged due to the unchange of the filtering process at
time k - 1. In addition, P- and Kk are not changed, so only
k
yk can be changed at time k, that is, the state deviation
that the adversary make in the next step can be denoted
as follows:
ak = Kkck
where ak is malicious errors that are introduced into the
original estimates xOk+ at time k, Kk is Kalman gain at time k,
and ck is the nonzero attack vector that the adversary adds
to the original sensor measurement vector yk at time k.
With the attack vector ck, the state at time k is as
follows:
x++ = xOk+ + Kkck
O k
where xOk++ is the state estimation after the attack is added.
At the next time k + 1, we have the following:
xOk+++1 = f xOk++, 0 + Kk+1 zk+1 - h f xOk++, 0 , 0
(44)
(45)
(47)
(48)
(49)
(50)
where zk+1 is the received measurement at time k + 1 and
zk+1 = yk+1 + ck+1. However, the parameter Kk+1 has
changed as the state estimation at time k becomes xk++.

On false data injection attacks
7. COUNTERMEASURES
In this section, we investigate two countermeasures. First,
we consider to enhance the resilience of the UKF technique
because the UKF technique achieves the best performance
in the three Kalman filtering techniques discussed
in Section 4. In this way, we can reduce the impact of false
data injection attacks. As this approach cannot solve the
problem completely, we propose a detection algorithm to
detect false data injection attacks.
7.1. Principle of the enhanced unscented
Kalman filter technique
To enhance the resilience of the UKF technique, we replace
the measurement noise R by R exp(|z - h(x)|). When the
predicted measurement and received measurement have
a large deviation, the increase of absolute residual vector
makes the measurement noise larger, leading to the
decrease of Kalman gain K. This will reduce the weight
of received measurement in the estimation and the estimation
performance can be preserved. Conversely, when
the deviation between the predicted measurement and the
received measurement is small, the decrease of absolute
residual vector will make the measurement noise
change marginally, leading to a very small impact on
estimation results.
7.2. Temporal-based detection algorithm
To detect the previous attacks, we propose the temporalbased
detection that uses the on-line nonparametric cumulative
sum (CUSUM) change detection mechanism [37].
Generally speaking, the CUSUM change detection algorithm
defines the two hypotheses: H0 (normal condition)
and H1 (being attacked). The CUSUM change detection
algorithm assumes that the observation y(i) begins with H0,
and at time ks, it changes to hypothesis H1. The goal of this
algorithm is to detect such a change as early as possible.
Given a suppressed false positive rate, the CUSUM algorithms
tend to minimize the time N (N ks), for which the
test stops and determines whether a change occurs or not.
The classical CUSUM statistic is updated on the basis
of the following:
S(k) = log
p1(y(k - 1))
p0(y(k - 1))
+
+ S(k - 1)
(51)
where S(0) = 0, (a)+ = a if a 0 and zero otherwise,
p1(y (k - 1)) and p0(y (k - 1)) is the probability distribution
of y(k - 1) under H1 and H0, respectively.
The detection time can be computed by the following:
N = inf{n : S(n)
n
}
where is the threshold selected on the basis of the false
positive rate.
(52)
843
On false data injection attacks
Q. Yang, L. Chang and W. Yu
In our experiment, the probability distribution p1(y(k 1))
and p0(y(k - 1)) are not known. Hence, we adopt the
nonparametric statistics mechanism that can avoid making
assumptions about the probability distribution of attacks.
Let zi(k) be the measurement of ith meter at time k. We
define the observation yi(i) as the following:
yi(k) = zi(k) - hi(xOk-, 0) - i
(53)
where i is determined by E0 zi(k) - hi xOk-, 0 (the
expected value of zi(k) - hi xOk-, 0 under H0). The
nonparametric CUSUM statistics for ith measurement is
as follows:
Si(k) = (Si(k - 1) + yi(k))+, Si(0) = 0
(54)
Then, a decision rule can be made by the following:
H0
Si(k) 7 i
H1
(55)
where i is the threshold determined on the basis of the
false positive rate for the ith measurement. Algorithm 2
shows the the detailed steps of temporal-based detection.
Algorithm 2 Temporal-based Detection Algorithm
1: Input:
zi(k): Observed measurement of the ith meter at time k;
hi(xOk-, 0): Pre-measurement of the ith meter at time k.
2: Parameters:
i: Detection threshold for the ith measurement;
i: Determined by E0 zi(k) - hi xOk-, 0 .
3: Output: ith meter is compromised by attacks or not.
4: Si(0) = 0
5: for Each measurement at time k do
6: Si(k) Si(k - 1) + zi(k) - hi xOk-, 0 - i
7: if Si(k) < 0 then
8: Si(k) 0
9: end if
10: if Si(k) i then
11: The ith meter is compromised by attacks and the detection
stops
else
12:
13: Wait for measurement at next time
14: end if
15: end for
To measure the effectiveness of temporal-based detection,
we consider two metrics: false positive rate and
detection time. The false positive rate is defined as the
probability of falsely rejecting the null hypothesis H0 and
the detection time is the average time that it takes to detect
attack. Obviously, the smaller the values of both metrics,
the higher performance of detection is. We show the evaluation
results of the temporal-based detection by using these
two metrics in Section 8.
844
8. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
In this section, we conduct experiments to investigate
the effectiveness of the attacks and the corresponding
countermeasures.
8.1. Experimental setup
The performance of proposed attack techniques and countermeasures
in Sections 5 and 7 have been validated on
IEEE 14-bus, IEEE 30-bus, IEEE 118-bus systems, respectively.
Note that although we conducted all experiments on
IEEE 14-bus, 30-bus, and 118-bus systems, we only show
the results of IEEE 14-bus and 30-bus systems in the evaluation
of attack approaches and the results of IEEE 30-bus
system in the evaluation of detection algorithm as the similar
results on other IEEE buses can be drawn. We simulated
our approaches by using MATLAB R2011b. All parameters
used in our experiments, including the real value
of state variables, sensor measurements, and the Jacobian
matrix, are based on the MATLAB package MATPOWER
[38]. We first evaluate four Kalman filtering techniques
(including the enhanced UKF proposed in Section 7) under
the normal condition and then evaluate the impact of attack
approaches. Lastly, we evaluate the effectiveness of the
temporal-based detection algorithm.
The performance comparison of four Kalman filtering
was conducted based on the following performance
index [12,15,39] that has been widely used to measure the
filtering capacities and is defined by the following:
Jk =
P ˇˇZO i - Zi+ˇˇ
ˇ k k ˇ
P ˇˇˇZik - Zi+ˇˇ
k ˇ
(56)
where ZO ik is the estimated measurement vector, Zik is the
noisy (real) measurement vector, and Zik+ is the true vector
of measurements. Obviously, the lower performance index
Jk, the more effective the filtering algorithm is.
8.2. Evaluation results
8.2.1. Results under normal conditions.
Figure 5 shows the performance index J of the four
Kalman filtering techniques for IEEE 14-bus, 30-bus, and
118-bus systems. Table III shows the mean value of performance
index of those four filtering techniques. From
Figure 5 and Table III, we can see that under the normal
operation, the descending order of the performance
index J is EKF, enhanced EKF, UKF, and enhanced UKF.
This confirms that in the normal condition to handle random
noise, the enhanced UKF achieves the highest filtering
capacity. In Table IV, we show the computation time of
those four filtering techniques. From Table IV, we can see
that the computation time increases as the improvement of
filtering capacity. In each recursive operation, EKF needs
to compute the Jacobian matrix and the state equation once

at every time, but UKF needs to conduct 2n + 1th computations
of the state equation at every time. This makes UKF
take more time to compute the state equation and a longer
time in the entire process. As expected, the enhanced
EKF and the enhanced UKF revised parameters in EKF
and UKF that makes them take a longer time than EKF
and UKF.
8.2.2. Results under false data injection attacks.
We investigate the performance index J under different
attacks discussed in Section 5, which can bypass
the anomaly detection. In the maximum magnitude-based
attack, the Jacobian matrix H will change greatly after
several steps, posing a negative innovation vector error

mance index J to 105 after a 10-step attack, posing a
substantial reduction of performance.
To verify the impact of the wave-based attack, positive
deviation attack, negative deviation attack and mixed
attack, we assume that the adversary launches attacks at
t 25. The curves in Figures 6, 7, 8, and 9 represent the
performance index J of four Kalman filtering techniques
after adding attacks in IEEE 14-bus and IEEE 30-bus
systems, respectively. Note that after a few steps attack,
Cholesky decomposition appears not positive definite in
UKF. In comparison with the three curves in Figure 6, we
can see that the performance index under the wave-based
attack can reach 1 - 4, the performance index under the
positive deviation attack and the negative deviation attack
approach 10 - 600 and 10 - 300, respectively. In comparison
with the three curves in Figure 7, we can see that the

performance index under the wave-based attack is 1 - 4, the
performance index under the positive deviation attack and
negative deviation attack are 10 - 450 and 10 - 450, respectively.
Our data shows that the positive deviation attack
and negative deviation attack can reduce the performance
more seriously than the wave-based attack. In addition, if
the adversary has enough information about the power system,
the performance of Kalman filter would be reduced
noticeably.
In comparison with the three curves in Figure 8, we can
see that the performance index under the negative/positivemixed
attack is 0.5 - 4, the performance index under
the wave/negative-mixed attack and wave/positive-mixed
attack are 1 - 4 and 1 - 5, respectively. Comparing with
three curves in Figure 9, we can see that the performance
index under the negative/positive-mixed attack is 0.5 846
4, the performance index under the wave/negative-mixed
attack and wave/positive-mixed attack are 1 - 8 and 1 - 9,
respectively. Our data shows that these three mixed attacks
can reduce the performance of Kalman filtering to the similar
level as the wave-based attack does, more slightly than
the positive deviation attack and negative deviation attack.
The reason is that the measurements in the mixed attack
and the wave-based attack are changed toward two directions,
but the measurements in positive deviation attack
and negative deviation attack are changed toward only
one direction.
From the results in Figure 6, 7, 8, and 9, we can see
the performance index J of both enhanced UKF and EKF
are smaller than that of UKF, indicating that the enhanced
UKF achieves a better performance than that of UKF and
the performance of EKF is better than that of UKF after

the attack is launched. We can also see that the performance
index J of the enhanced EKF are the smallest after
the attack is introduced, indicating that the enhanced EKF
achieves the best performance after the attack is launched.
These results indicate that the enhanced EKF achieves the
best performance and UKF achieves the worst performance
in terms of robustness.
8.2.3. Results of temporal-based detection.
To validate the temporal-based detection algorithm,
we implemented the detection algorithm in IEEE 14-bus,
IEEE 30-bus, and IEEE 118-bus systems. Here, we only
show the results of IEEE 30-bus in the evaluation of the
detection algorithm as similar observations on other IEEE
bus systems can be drawn. In our experiments, we take
the EKF technique as an example and choose the meters
of z8, z56, and z102 in IEEE 30-bus system, which measure
the node voltage of V8, the power injections of P26,
and the power flow of P6-10, respectively. We run simulations
for 10,000 times without attacks and compute
the mean value of zi(k) - hi xOk-, 0 under H0: E0i =
E0 zi(k) - hi xOk-, 0 . We then obtain E08 = 0.7348, E056 =
1.5825, and E102 = 0.3534 in IEEE 30-bus system. After

that, we round up the two most significant units and obtain
8 = 0.74, 56 = 1.6, 102 = 0.36 in IEEE 30-bus system.
We run simulations for 1000 times without attacks and
compute the total number of false positives for different
values of . The false positive rate, PF can be defined as
PF = #false alarms . Figure 10 show the results for z8, z56,
1000
and z102 in IEEE 30-bus system. For z56 in IEEE 30-bus

system, we can see the false positive rate become very low
when we set 56 > 20. Figures 11 and 12 show the average
detection time by conducting 1000 times experiments
based on our proposed temporal-based algorithm in terms
of thresholds: z8, z56, z102 in IEEE 30-bus system. As we
can see, the detection time increases as the threshold
increases. As we know that is selected based on the false
positive rate and there is a tradeoff between the detection
time and false positives. From Figure 10, we can see that
selecting as high as possible for each sensor can reduce
false positives. Nevertheless, increasing leads to more
time to detect attacks.
9. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we investigated the false data injection
attacks against Kalman filtering and developed countermeasures
to mitigate such attacks. We first systematically
compared the three representative Kalman filtering techniques
for the dynamic state estimation for power systems.
We then formalized the anomaly detection in Kalman filtering
and investigated five types of attacks to avoid the
anomaly detection. We discussed the false data injection
attacks on other modules in the smart grid in addition
to the state estimation. To evaluate the effectiveness of
those attacks, we implemented those attacks and evaluated
the impact of those attacks on the performance
reduction of Kalman filtering on IEEE 14-bus, 30-bus,
and 118-bus systems, respectively. To mitigate attacks,
we developed countermeasures through enhancing the

resilience of Kalman filtering and developing a temporalbased
detection scheme. Our experimental data shows that
enhancing the resilience of Kalman filtering technique can
maintain the performance to some extent and our developed
temporal-based detection technique can detect attacks
accurately and quickly.
