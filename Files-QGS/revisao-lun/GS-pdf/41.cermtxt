the unique environment of smart grid networks.
In this paper, we consider a counter-measurement strategy
of the data injection attack at the control center in the form
of adversary detection. The problem formulation of detecting
the false data injection is based on the bad data detection
(BDD) on smart grid state estimation. The proposed algorithm,
"adaptive CUSUM Test", is recursive in nature, and each
recursion comprises two interleaved stages: Stage 1 introduces
the linear unknown parameter solver technique, and Stage
2 applies the multi-thread CUSUM algorithm for quickest
change detection. The proposed scheme is able to determine
the possible existence of adversary at the control center as
quickly as possible without violating the given constraints such
as a certain level of detection accuracy and false alarm. The
performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by both
mathematic analysis and numerical simulation.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The
system model is given in Section II. The proposed scheme
- adaptive CUSUM algorithm is given and analyzed mathematically
in Section III. The numerical results are provided in
Section IV, and the conclusion is given in Section V.
II. PROBLEM FORMULATION
A. Active PowerFlow Models
A power system is composed by a collection of power
lfow meters, transmission lines, and buses. Assuming the
power system has n+1 buses, we consider model of active
power-oflw Pij , active power injections Pi , and bus phase
angles ()i, where i = 1,··· ,n+ 1 . Assuming the power
network has reached a steady state, and the resistance in the
transmission line connecting buses i and j is small compared
to its reactance, the active power-oflw model [14] from bus i
to bus j can be described as:
Pij= V; V.;.
<J
sin(()i - ()j),
where Vi is the voltage level at bus i, and Xij is the reactance
between bus i and bus j. At bus i, active power Pi can also
be injected through a generator. A negative Pi represents the
power load. Without lost of generality, no energy is loss or
dissipated, and the conservation of energy yields that for all
buses it holds that:
Pi=
L Pik, Vi
kEvi
where iI is the set of all buses connected to bus i.
B. State Estimation
We consider the state-estimation problem as estimating n
phase angles ()i, by observing the real-time measurements
(1)
(2)
of active power-flow. The initial phase angle ()l is known
as reference angle, and therefore only n angles have to be
estimated. The voltage level of each bus and reactance of each
transmission line are assumed to be known.
At time t, the control center observes a vector Zt of actual
power-oflw measurements for m active power-oflw branches.
Each active branch is composed by two meters and one
transmission-line. The observation can be described as follows:
Zt= Pt+e=
h(x)+ e,
(3)
where Zt = [Zt,l,···, Zt,mV is the vector power-oflw
measurement, h(x) is the actual power-oflw model derived
using (1) and (2), the system state xis the vector of n bus
phase angles ()i, and e = (e l,···, emf is the Gaussian
measurement noise with zero mean and covariance matrix e:E.
If we temperately neglect the time index t, to estimate the
unknown bus phase angles from the power oflw measurements
Z, the Gauss-Newton method is applied [15]:
xk+l= xk+ H( f:E;l
Hk) -lHf:E; l[Z - h( Xk)],
(4)
where the estimated system state xk E IRn, k is iteration
number, and Hk E IR m is Jacobian evaluated at xk,
If the phase diefrences (()i - () j) in (1) is small, then the linear
approximation model of (3) can be described as:
Z=Hx+e
where H E IR m is the constant Jacobian matrix, and the
estimated system state x is:
(5)
(6)
(7)
For the bad-datedetection (BDD) system (e.g. sensor faulty,
topological error), we compare the power-oflw measurements
Z with the estimated active power-oflw Z by the phase angle
estimate x. Z can be written as:
where <;S is known as "hat matrix" [15]. However, if the
adversary performs an unobservable attack by injecting the
malicious data like described in [16], BDD system is unable
to detect the unobservable attack due to the insignificance in
comparison with arbitrarily large estimation error. According
to [16], if the nonzero k-sparse a is existed in the system,
where vector a = He is the malicious data injected by an
adversary, no detector can distinguish xfrom x+c as shown
in (9).
Z=Hx+a+e=H·(x+c)+e,
(9)
where a = [al,l = 1, 2,···, mJT. When the adversary's
malicious data is injectedat the true state xin the system, the
xleads the control center to believe that true state is x+ c,
and c can be in any form such as scaled or vectored arbitrarily.
Therefore, it is so-called stealth (unobservable) attack.

III. ADAPTIVE CUSUM ALGORITHM
In this paper, we propose an adaptive CUSUM algorithm for
quickest change detection with a linear unknown parameter
solver. The unknown parameter exists in the post-change
distribution and may changes over the detection process. The
proposed scheme does not require the Maximum Likelihood
(ML) estimate of the unknown parameter thereby making the
computation process much simpler. To formulate the detection
problem at the control center, the non-Bayesian approach
is applied because of the unknown prior probability of the
adversary and unknown statistical model for the adversary
vector.
we consider the control center monitors a subdivision of
a smart grid network with n active buses. Zt,m represents
th
the observation at the m measurement at time t. When the
system is at the normal state (no adversary), we assume a
Bayesian model of the random state variables with multivariate
Gaussian distribution N(P,z ,Ez) and p'z = Om without loss
of generality. The adversary is assumed inactive initially; At
randomly unknown time T, it becomes active to inject the
malicious data. Under observation of (9), the binary hypothesis
can be formulated:
{ HHIo:: ZZtt rvrv NN((Oat,,EEzz),), (10)
where at = [at,I,at,2,'" ,at ,m]T,E IR m is the unknown
attacker vector to inject malicious data at time t , and Ez
is HExHT + Ee. In other words, a change of the distribution
from N(O ,Ez) to N(at, Ez) at the unknown time T.
Let Th donate the stopping time, which the change is
detected. If Th < T, then it is the false alarm, and the average
run length (ARL) is Tf = Eo[Th] , where Eo is the average
before the change. If Th > T, then Th -T is the detection delay
and Td donate the ARL of detection delay. Based on Lorden's
formulation [7], we minimize the worst case of detection delay,
which can be described as:

the unknown while considering the worst case of the unknown
parameter, which is potentially maximized. Thus, by applying
GLRT in CUSUM algorithm, we can ensure a certain level
of detection accuracy for QD, while minimizing the potential
efect rfom the unknown in the system. We test-drive and
formulate this idea into our detection problem. At time t, the
cumulative statistic in (13) can be re-written for our problem
as :
where at,! represents lth unknown element in unknown adversary
vector a under the current time t. However, the recursive
expression of (16) for CUSUM Test is no longer available as
shown in (15). It is because GLRT needs to compute every
unknown element of a for each measurement at time t by
estimating from the observations up to the current time t.
In other words, GLRT approach on CUSUM requires storing
the observation and ML-estimating the unknown parameter
at every point. Thus, in reality, GLRT is too dificult to be
applied into quickest detection model from the view points of
hardware and software implementation.
For multi-thread CUSUM algorithm with unknown parameters,
the better approach is to solve recursively, avoiding
complex ML estimation, and implemented in practice. Thus,
we consider the Rao test [18], which is the asymptotically
equivalent test model of GLRT. The derivation of Rao test
is similar to the locally most powerful (LMP) test but only
much simpler; Rao test has the straight-forward calculation
by taking derivative with respect to the unknown parameter
evaluated at the unknown parameter equal to zero. Thus, for at
near a w, e can achieve approximate maximum outcome with
a certain level of FAR by maximizing Bfe tlat) as shown in
(17). In addition, the Rao test also doesn't inv lve the complex
computation like the ML estimation does. The statistic [18] of
the Rao test for the observations can be modified and rewritten
as follows at time t:
(16)
(17)
where ao is set to zero for our problem, and J( ) is the
Fisher information matrix [19] evaluated at at = a B.y
inspecting (17), We know that the Rao test is two-side test,
therefore it is in quadratic form. The computation of the
inverse fisher information matrix is usually demanded in multiparameter
environment. In our problem, the unknown a is
always positive. Thus, the necessity of the quadratic form can
be omitted. At time t, the linear model of (17) can be described
as:
and
Zt =
at =
[Zt,l: Zt,l,Zt,2,... ,Zt,m]T
[at,l: at,l,at,2,... ,at,m]T,
(19)
that is not in a quadratic form, and no need to store the
observation and re-calculate the unknown parameter at every
time internal. By setting at to Om, the unknown matrix can be
minimized in the system. The linear unknown parametersolver
in (18) is also allowed the multi-thread CUSUM algorithm
with unknown parameters to compute recursively for test
statistic. Now, we can apply the linear unknown parameter
solver (18) into the multi-thread CUSUM algorithm.
Based on (10), we can write the binary hypothesis { Ho,H1}
by expanding the multivariate normal distributions:
exp [-0.5 (Zt)TEl;- (Zt)]
(271")0.5", det(Ez)O.5 ,
exp [-0.5(Zt -at)TE;-1 (Zt-at)]
(271")0.5", det(Ez)0.5
(20)
So, the multi-thread CUSUM statistic with unknown parameter
can be derived as:
St = max12k2Th 'Li!k
log [exp (Z[:E;l
L' 1;:
at + a[;:ElZt
- a[:E;l at)],
(21)
Next, we apply the linear unknown parameter solver from the
result of (18) to each mth log likelihood ratio term in (21)
by taking its derivative with respect to al evaluated at al = 0
in the unknown vector at at time t. We can rewrite (15) and
then formulate the linear-based multi-thread CUSUM statistic
by recursion as follows:

From the visional inspection of (22), we know Blog xap(ab) =

Notes that the control center observes a vector Zt of actual
power-oflw measurements for m active power-oflw branches
at time t, Zt E {Zt,l},and at E {at,l} where l = 1, 2,···,m.
With these two interleaved steps: the linear unknown parameter
solver and multi-thread CUSUM test, we construct the
proposed scheme, which is named the "adaptive CUSUM
algorithm". The control center is able to tackle with the
unobservable attack (malicious data injection) by examining
adaptive CUSUM statistic in (22) against the threshold h in
(13) at time t; h is the detection threshold to be set according
to the desired value of the false alarm rate (FAR) and miss
detection rate (MDR); the alarm rise as little delay as possible

IV. NUMERICALRES ULTS
In this section, we present the numerical simulations to
demonstrate the performance of the proposed scheme with the
following setup. The simulation performs under IEEE 4-bus
test system for the power network as shown in Figure 2. Each
bus has its corresponded voltage (Vi) and phase angle (8i);
the dots represents availableactive power-oflw measurements.
The total number of the measurements from this IEEE 4-bus
test system is four, which are P = [Pl, H2, P24, PdT. The
bus phase angle 81 is set to zero as the reference angle. The
normal state in the power system is assumed to be initially
drawn from the multivariate normal distribution N(O , z). z
is in term of e, which sets equivalently to the identify matrix.
After passing the unknown period of time, the adversary start
to inject the malicious data at time T that are drawn ofrm
N( a, z). The detector has none information about the matrix
a's statistical model, distribution, or prior probabilities. The
adversary manipulatesand injectsthe false datainto the system
at the random time.
The simulation of the adaptive CUSUM algorithm is shown
in Figure 3 with the constant probability of detection eror. We
consider that Case 1 with FAR of 1% and Case 2 with FAR of

T = 6 from N(O , z) to N( a, z), where a is unknown. For
both cases, the curve of adaptive CUSUM statistic (St) shows
the sudden increase right aeftr a change of distributions. The
proposed algorithm quickly responses the abnormal event by
signaling an alarm of out-of-control. At time 7, the threshold
parameters hl and h2 are corresponded to Case 1 and Case
2, respectively. As a result in Figure 3, hl is less than h2,
because of the different FARs. For the higher successful
rate of detection, the stricter constraint (smaller FAR) causes
increasing the threshold, which sets the higher requirement for
system to declare the decision from the observation. The above
statement is corresponded to the simulation results in Figure
4 and Figure 5, which are explained in the next paragraph.
ARL (Th) of adaptive CUSUM algorithm is 7 and 8 at St
of 6.23 (Case 1) and 11.49 (Case 2), respectively. ARL (Td)
of detection delay is 1 for cases 1 and 2 for the Case 2 in
this simulation. The proposed algorithm is able to signal the
alarm and terminates the process aeftr the active malicious
date attack; the detection delay occurs because of the missing
detection at time 6 as shown in Figure 3. The system continues
the detection process until the CUSUM statistic St. which
excesses the threshold. However, the detection accuracy of
the proposed scheme is comparable high while maintaining
a certain level of detection error rate.
Both Figure 4 and Figure 5 shows the characteristics of
the proposed algorithm by varying FAR for the detection
probability PD and the expectional ARL (E(Td))of detection
delay. To compute PD and E(Td)w,e run 5000 realizations for
the simulation. MDR is set to the constant 1%, and FAR is vary
from 10 -10 to 10 -2.The change T of distribution is randomly
selected. E(Tdo)f detection delay is computed by subtracting
T from E(Th)' The simulation result shows that the algorithm
maintains the fairly good detection accuracy of 67% and 1

4-5, we know the tradeoff between the detection accuracy and
ARL; the higher detection accuracy (the smaller FAR) causes
higher ARL (the higher E(Td))i,.e., the system needs to spend
more time for making a decision. E(Td)decreases as FAR
increases, of course, the PD decreases because of the loss of
constraints; in this case, the constraint is FAR. The loss of
constraints also benefits
the quicker detection (less detection
delay) but may degrading the accuracy of detection. Therefore,
the tradeof between the constraints and the detection accuracy
needs to be addressed carefully since it may have the great
impact on the output parameters.
V. CO NCLUSION
In this paper, we have studied malicious node quickest
detection in smart grid networks. We propose the adaptive
CUSUM algorithm for defending false data injection attack
in smart grid networks. Our proposed scheme for smart grid
state estimation composes two interleaved stages: Stage 1
introduces the linear unknown parameter solver technique,
and Stage 2 applies the multi-thread CUSUM algorithm for
determining the possible existence of adversary at the control
center as quickly as possible without violating the given
constraints while maintaining a certain low level of detection
error rate. The analysis and numerical simulation results have
shown that the proposed scheme achieved good performance
while maintaining a certain level of detection accuracy and
detection delay. The proposed adaptive CUSUM algorithm is
not only simple but also eficient
in term of detection accuracy
and minimum ARL. The numerical simulation of FAR verses
E(Td)and PD also helps us to understand the characteristics
of the proposed scheme. Finally, the proposed scheme in this
paper is able to achieve the important objectives of smart
grid security in term of the real-time operation and security
requirement.
