state variables might be protected ofrm

cases, the adversary has the additionalconstraints
of making the values of the attack vector a corresponding

we generate the undirected graph GH with incidencematrix
AH from H. Every measurementin AH leads to an edge in
GH of unit weight. To include the additional constraintsdue
to protected sets Sm and Sv, we modify
GH as follows:

Numerical simulations on IEEE testcases are used to show
the advantagesof our proposed algorithms andcompare them
to other approaches. This work onlow-complexityalgorithms
can be extended to include other adversarial attack models
with diferent constraintsand objectives. Another extension
includes the placement of limited number of secure phasor
