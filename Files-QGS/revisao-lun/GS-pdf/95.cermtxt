Abstract-Data injection is a cyber-attack in which an attacker
targets the state estimator of the smart grid with the aim to
alter the estimation of the system's real-time state. Using data
injection, an adversary can manipulate the calculation of the realtime
locational marginal prices to reap financial benefit. Even
though data injection attacks have attracted significant attention
recently, remarkably, all of the existing works focus on cases in
which a single adversary is present. In contrast, in this paper,
multiple data injection attackers are considered. The problem is
formulated as a noncooperative game between the attackers and
the smart grid defender. In this game, each attacker chooses a data
injection attack while the defender chooses measurements to protect
in order to thwart the attacks. The Nash equilibrium of this game is
characterized and the effect of the strategies taken by the attackers
and defender on the system is analyzed. Our results show how, at the
equilibrium, multiple attacks can eliminate the effect of one another
thus requiring no defense. However, under different conditions, a
defense mechanism can be beneficial in reducing the combined
effect of the different attacks on the system. Numerical results
using the WSCC 9-bus system are used to validate the derived
analytical solution. These results also shed light on the effect of the
cost of defense on the attackers' and defender's optimal strategies
and utilities. Accordingly, we show that a higher cost of defense
makes attackers more likely to attack and worsens the defender's
expected utility.
I. INTRODUCTION
The recent introduction of advanced metering infrastructures
as well as advanced data collection and communication nodes
have rendered the smart electric grid more vulnerable to cyberattacks
[1]. In particular, data injection attacks have emerged
as a highly malicious type of cyber-attacks in which malicious
adversaries target the state estimator of the power system in order
to alter the estimate of the real-time system state by manipulating
a number of measurements [1].
Data injection has a detrimental effect on the power system
since it targets the state estimator, an integral component of the
smart grid which is used by the system operator to monitor,
protect, control, and economically operate the system [2]. The
goals from data injection attacks can be varied and they can
range from compromising the security of the grid to impeding
the real-time operation of the system or making financial profit
through energy prices manipulation.
Data injection attacks are challenging by nature due to their
stealthiness which makes the task of detecting them arduous [1].
In fact, data injection attacks can alter the estimation process
while remaining unnoticed by the operator.
Recently, data injection attacks have attracted significant attention
[1], [3]-[5]. The authors in [1] introduce an optimal data
injection scheme and derive an optimized subset of measurements
that can be defended to face this attack. The work in
[3] introduces a stealthy data injection attack scheme that can
evade detection when compromising a number of measurements.
This research was supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation under
Grant CNS-1446621.
An analysis of the economic effects of data injection on energy
markets is discussed in [4]. In [5], a zero-sum game is formulated
between an attacker and a defender in which the attacker
modifies an estimated line flow to manipulate prices.
While interesting, this existing body of literature [1], [3]-[5]
(and references therein) has primarily focused on investigating a
class of stealthy attacks by one attacker and studying their effect
on the smart grid's security or economics. However, in practice,
due to their efficacy and stealthiness, data injection attacks can
occur concurrently from multiple adversaries that can target
various state estimation sensors. Moreover, [1], [3], [4] focus
primarily on the attacker's strategy with no modeling of possible
attacker-defender strategic interaction while in [5], the attacker
and defender interaction is restricted to modifying the power flow
over a given line. To our best knowledge, somewhat remarkably,
no existing work has studied the impact of data injection attacks
that are carried out by multiple adversaries. In fact, due to
the networked nature of the smart grid, the manipulation of
measurements in one part of the system, by an adversary, impacts
the system as a whole. Hence, an attack carried out by one
attacker does not only impact the grid's performance, but it
also affects the benefits of all other attackers in the system.
This interconnection can be, on the one hand, beneficial to the
smart grid for cases in which the different simultaneous attacks
mitigate the severity of one another leading, thus, to a reduced
combined effect. On the other hand, multiple attacks can lead to a
more severe combined effect on the electric grid which, in turn,
can make the task of defending the system more challenging.
Clearly, there is a need for a strategic model to analyze and
understand these interdependencies between attackers.
The main contribution of this paper is to introduce a novel
game-theoretic approach to analyze data injections attacks that
involve a defender and multiple adversaries. In the studied game,
each attacker chooses a data injection attack to maximize the
trade-off between the benefits, earned through prices manipulation,
and costs associated with the attack. Meanwhile, the
defender chooses a set of measurements to defend in order to
block potential attacks and reduce their effect on the system
while optimizing a utility that captures both the benefits and
costs of the chosen defense strategy. For the formulated game,
we characterize the Nash equilibrium and we study its properties
by analyzing the overall effect of the defense and attack strategies
on the system. Our results show that, at the equilibrium, multiple
attacks can eliminate one another thus requiring no defense. On
the other hand, under different conditions, defensive actions can
be beneficial and can reduce the attacks' effect. Numerical results
using the WSCC 9-bus system are used to validate the derived
analytical solution. From this numerical application, we also
study the impact of the cost of defense on the optimal strategies
and utilities of the attackers and defender. Our results show that

The DA and RT LMPs at each bus, 𝑖 , are outputs of the DA

of energy of an incremental load at bus 𝑖 as well as the cost of
the contribution of this bus to the congestion in the system. The
DA and RT LMPs at bus 𝑖 can be computed as follows:
a higher cost of defense makes attackers more likely to attack
and worsens the expected utility of the defender.

A. Energy Markets
II. SYSTEM MODEL AND PROBLEM FORMULATION
Consider a competitive energy market architecture based on
day ahead (DA) and real time (RT) markets. In the DA market,
hourly locational marginal prices (LMPs), 𝜇 𝐷?
, are generated
by the operator for the next operating day [6]. Market clearing
is executed based on the solution of a linearized optimal power
flow (DCOPF) problem that outputs the optimal dispatch of each
participating generator and the DA LMP at each bus [6]. The
DCOPF formulation is as follows [2]:

∑(𝑃
𝑖 − 𝐷 𝑖 )𝜒 𝑙,𝑖 ⩽ 𝐹 𝑙 max, ∀𝑙 ∈ {1, ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ , 𝐿 },
where 𝑁, 𝐺
and 𝐿 are the number of buses, generators, and lines
respectively. 𝐶 𝑖 is the offer of generator 𝑖 while 𝑃 𝑖 and 𝐷 𝑖 are,
respectively, the power injection and load at bus 𝑖 . If no generator
(load) is connected to bus 𝑖 , 𝑃 𝑖 = 0 (𝐷 𝑖 = 0). 𝑃 𝑖
correspond to the lower and upper output limits of generator 𝑖 .
Constraints (4) and (5) represent the limit of the power flow
on line 𝑙 which cannot exceed the thermal limit 𝐹 𝑙
line flow is associated with a given reference direction. If the
max. Each
flow is in the opposite direction, it is represented by a negative
power quantity. Hence, constraint (4) corresponds to the thermal
limit of a line in its assumed reference direction while constraint
(5) corresponds to the thermal limit of a line where the flow is
opposite to its assumed reference direction. 𝑿

shift factor matrix which defines the relationship between the
power injection at each bus, 𝑷 , and the flow over each line, 𝑭 :

?? (𝐿 ×1) = 𝑿 (𝐿 ×𝐺 ) × 𝑷 (𝐺 ×1),
where the elements of 𝑿
that are associated with the system's
reference bus are equal to 0. 𝜒 𝑙,𝑖 corresponds to the shift factor
of a generation at bus 𝑖 on a line 𝑙 .
On the other hand, in RT, an ex-post model uses actual realtime
operation conditions estimated using the state estimator,
instead of a projection of the system conditions like in DA, to
generate real-time LMPs, 𝜇 𝑅?
[6]. The RT LMPs are generated
using an incremental DCOPF which is formulated as follows [6]:

Since the RT LMPs calculation relies on the outcome of
the state estimator, data injection attacks which target the state
estimation can impact the LMPs in (13). Accordingly, next, we
introduce the model of data injection attacks.
B. State Estimation and Data Injection Attacks
Using a state
estimator,
multiple
power measurements
throughout the smart grid are used to estimate the system
states [8]. The measurement vector, 𝒛 , is related to the vector of
system states, 𝜽 , through the following linearized model:
?? = 𝑯?
+ 𝒆 ,
where 𝑯
is the measurement Jacobian matrix and 𝒆 is the
vector of random errors assumed to follow a normal distribution,
?? (0, 𝑹 ). Using a weighted least square estimator the estimated
system states are given by [8]:
?? ˆ = (𝑯 𝑇 𝑹 −1𝑯 )−1𝑯 𝑇 𝑹 −1𝒛 .
The estimated measurements, 𝒛ˆ, and the residuals, 𝒓 , can be
computed as follows [8]:
??ˆ = 𝑯 𝜽 ˆ = 𝑺? , 𝒓 = 𝒛 − 𝒛ˆ = (𝑰 𝑛 − 𝑺 )𝒛 = 𝑾 𝒛

By attacking the system measurements, the adversary seeks to
manipulate the real-time LMPs, 𝜇 𝑅?
, to make a financial benefit
through virtual bids similarly to the case in [4].
Virtual bidding is a platform through which entities that do
not own any physical generation nor load can participate in the
energy market settlements through virtual supply and demand
offers. Accordingly, an entity that buys (sells) virtual power at a
given bus in DA has to sell (buy) that same power at the same bus
in RT. In this regard, virtual bidders aim to profit from potential
mismatch between DA and RT LMPs [6].
III. PROPOSED GAME AND SOLUTION
A. Game Formulation
Given the coupling in the goals and actions of the 𝑀
attackers
as well as the defender, we use noncooperative game
theory [9] to analyze their optimal decision making processes. In
particular, we formulate a static, strategic noncooperative game
set, composed of all 𝑀
Ξ = ⟨𝒫 , (𝒜 𝑖 )𝑖 ∈𝒫 , (𝑈 𝑖 )𝑖 ∈𝒫 ⟩, where 𝒫
attackers and the defender that is referred
≜ ℳ ∪ {0} is the players'
which consists of choosing an attack/defense vector, 𝒂 𝑖
to via index 0, 𝒜 𝑖 is the set of actions available to player 𝑖 ∈ 𝒫
and 𝑈 𝑖 is the utility function of player 𝑖 . In this game, each
,
attacker, 𝑚
∈ ℳ, selects an attack vector, 𝒛 (𝑚 ) ≜ 𝒂 𝑚
that maximizes its utility 𝑈 𝑚 . This utility function must capture
the financial benefit earned by means of virtual bidding. Virtual
bidding is a process in which 𝑚
respectively, buses 𝑖 𝑚
and 𝑗 𝑚
buys and sells 𝑃 𝑚
MW at,
in DA; whereas, in RT, 𝑚
sells
and buys 𝑃 𝑚
MW at, respectively, buses 𝑖 𝑚
and 𝑗 𝑚 . Thus, the
goal of each attacker is to optimize the following:

and ∥𝒂 𝑚 ∥0 is the number of non-zero elements in 𝒂 𝑚 .

over some measurement locations to block potential attacks. The

potential data injection attackers in a smart grid setting.
B. Attackers' Coupling
case of 𝑀
as follows:
Given the networked nature of the power system, the attackers'
actions are highly coupled. In fact, an attacker manipulating a
set of measurements would alter the whole estimation outcome
and, thus, affect the actions and utilities of other attackers. In the
attackers, the resulting estimates, 𝒛ˆ

(𝑚 )
⇒ Δ𝒛ˆ =
(𝑚 ),
(23)
where Δ𝒛ˆ is the corresponding change in the generated estimates
due to the 𝑀
attacks. Hence, the success of attacker 𝑚
in
manipulating a targeted measurement 𝑧 𝑖 is highly influenced by
the remaining attackers. In fact, as shown next in Proposition 1,
?? 's action effectiveness can be significantly attenuated by other
attackers' actions.
Proposition 1: Depending on their targeted measurements, the
attackers' actions can eliminate the impact of one another.
Proof: Consider the case of two attackers where attacker 1
(attacker 2) aims at increasing the estimated flow, 𝑧ˆ𝑖 (𝑧ˆ𝑗 ), over
line 𝑙 𝑖 (𝑙 𝑗 ) to create a false congestion. Hence, the aim of attacker
1 (attacker 2) is to achieve Δ𝑧ˆ𝑖 ⩾ 𝐹 𝑙 𝑖
max
− ??ˆ𝑖 (Δ𝑧ˆ𝑗 ⩾ 𝐹 𝑙 𝑗
max
− ??ˆ𝑗 ).
Following from (23), the change to 𝑧ˆ𝑖 and 𝑧ˆ𝑗 introduced by the
two attacks is expressed as:
Δ𝑧ˆ𝑖 = 𝑠 𝑖,𝑖 𝑧 (1) + 𝑠 𝑖,𝑗 𝑧
??
??(2), Δ𝑧ˆ𝑗 = 𝑠 ,𝑗𝑗 ?? (2) + 𝑠 ,𝑗𝑖 𝑧
??
??(1),
(24)
where 𝑠 𝑖,𝑗
is the element (𝑖, 𝑗 ) of matrix 𝑺 . When the mea??
??
surement errors are independent and identically distributed (i.e.
= 𝜎 2𝑰 𝑛 ), 𝑺 is a symmetric matrix. This property can be easily
proven based on (15) and (16) by showing that 𝑺 𝑇
= 𝑺
when
= 𝜎 2𝑰 𝑛 . Due to the symmetry of 𝑺 , 𝑠 𝑖,𝑗
= 𝑠 ,𝑗𝑖 . Consider
the case in which 𝑠 𝑖,𝑗
< 0, both attackers' actions mitigate
the effect of one another. In fact, since 𝑠 𝑖,𝑗
reduces Δ𝑧ˆ𝑖 (Δ𝑧ˆ𝑗 ) preventing it from causing any congestion
over line 𝑙 𝑖 (𝑙 ?? ). On the other hand, if 𝑠 𝑖?
> 0, each of the
attackers' actions would help the other achieve its goal. This
result obviously generalizes to the case of 𝑀
attackers.
In addition to the coupling in their actions, the utilities of
the different attackers are also highly interdependent. In fact, as
shown in Proposition 2, an attacker can make financial benefit

(20)

Proposition 2: By properly choosing the nodes on which to
place a virtual bid, an attacker can profit from other attackers'
actions.
Proof: A created or eliminated congestion on one line of
the system has a global effect on the LMPs of the whole system.
Following (18), attacker 𝑚 's financial return in the presence of
??
attackers is governed by:
?? 𝑚 = (𝜇 𝑖𝑅? 𝑚
− 𝜇 𝑖𝐷? 𝑚
) + (𝜇 𝑗𝐷? 𝑚
− 𝜇 𝑗𝑅? 𝑚 ).
Replacing the expressions of the DA and RT LMPs from (12)
??
?? =1
and (13) in (25) returns:
?? 𝑚 = ∑[(𝜒 𝑙,𝑖 𝑚 − 𝜒 𝑙,𝑗 𝑚 )×
((𝜆 𝑙
?𝑇,

?𝐴,

Hence, depending on the sign of (𝜒 𝑙,𝑖 𝑚
??
𝑙,𝑗 𝑚 ) (dictated by the
choice of virtual bid nodes 𝑖 𝑚 and 𝑗 𝑚 ) a change in the congestion
status of line 𝑙 between DA and RT, due to the various attacks,
can either return a financial benefit or loss to attacker 𝑚
even
without choosing to carry out any attack.
Then, the combined attack of the

C. Game Solution
In this section, for tractability and illustration purposes, we
consider a case study consisting of two attackers and one
defender, i.e. 𝒫
≜ {0, 1, 2}, where each attacker/defender is
able to attack/defend one measurement at a time, i.e. 𝐵 0 =
?? 1
= 𝐵 2
= 1. The considered power grid is assumed to
have two vulnerable lines. Vulnerable lines are defined as lines
that are subject to data injection attacks due to their relatively
low security measures. The action space of each of the two
attackers is 𝒜 𝑚
≜ {
?? (𝑚 ), 𝑧 n(o𝑚 )}, for 𝑚
chooses to carry out attack, 𝑧 (𝑚 ), over a chosen vulnerable line
or not to launch any attack 𝑧 n(o𝑚 ). The defender's action space is
?? 0 ≜ {𝑎 0,1, 𝑎 0,2, 𝑎 0,no} where 𝑎 0,1 and 𝑎 0,2 denote the actions of
placing a secured measurement at the location attacked by either
attacker 1 or 2, and 𝑎 0,no denotes the action of not defending any
of the measurements. The case in which the two attackers target
the same measurement is a trivial case that is not considered
since it leads to a high associated measurement residual violating
∈ {1, 2}, where 𝑚
constraint (19).
One suitable solution concept for this game is the so-called
pure-strategy Nash equilibrium (PSNE) which is a state of the
game in which none of the attackers nor the defender can
unilaterally change their action choice; given the action choices
of their opponents.
To find the PSNE, we use the matrix representation in Table I
which enables us to view the utilities of the three players for

the different attack and defense strategies where 𝑐 𝑖 (𝑎 𝑖 ) has been
simply denoted as 𝑐 𝑖 . 𝑓 𝑖,𝑗
refers to the benefit (or loss) that
attacker 𝑖 reaps when 𝑗 carries out a successful attack, which
can be obtained from (18) and (26). Moreover, 𝑑 1 and 𝑑 2 denote,
respectively, the utility function of the defender when either
attacker 1 or 2 launches its attack while no defense is taken.
To derive the game's solution, we assume that the cost of attack
is such that 𝑐 1 < ∣𝑓 𝑖,𝑗 ∣ and 𝑐 2 < ∣𝑓 𝑖,𝑗 ∣ for 𝑖, 𝑗
∈ {1, 2}.
In this game solution, similarly to Proposition 1, when both
attackers launch their respective attacks, their actions eliminate
one another. Clearly, the PSNE of this game depends on the sign
of 𝑓 𝑖,𝑗 . In this regard, we examine two cases.
(0, −𝑐 1, In
case 1, we consider the scenario in which the action of
one attacker results in a financial loss to the other attacker when
the latter chooses not to carry out any attack. Hence, in this
case 𝑓 1,2 < 0 and 𝑓 2,1 < 0. The PSNE of this game is unique
and it corresponds to the case in which both attackers choose to
attack and the defender chooses not to take any defensive actions,
(𝑎 0∗, 𝑎 1∗, 𝑎 2∗) = (𝑎 0,𝑛? , 𝑧 (1), 𝑧 (2)), which results in (𝑈 0, 𝑈 1, 𝑈 2) =
?? 2). In fact, at this PSNE, none of the attackers has an
incentive to unilaterally deviate from this equilibrium since by
unilaterally choosing not to attack, an attacker incurs a bigger
financial loss; while by choosing to defend, the defender achieves
a worse utility. In fact, the defender achieves its best possible
utility at this equilibrium; hence, any taken defensive action, in
this case, serves to worsen its outcome.
In case 2, we consider the scenario in which attacker 1 is
subject to a positive profit due to attacker 2's attack while,
on the other hand, attacker 2 is subject to a negative profit
due to attacker 1's attack. This case, hence, corresponds to
?? 1,2 > 0 and 𝑓 2,1 < 0. In this case, (𝑎 0,𝑛? , 𝑧 (1), 𝑧 (2)) is not a
PSNE. The game's equilibrium highly depends on the considered
costs of attack and defense which makes the existence of a
PSNE dependent on the considered costs. Therefore, we look
at characterizing the Nash equilibrium under mixed strategies.
A mixed strategy associates a probability distribution 𝛼 𝑖 (𝑎 𝑖 )
with the pure strategies 𝑎 𝑖
∈ 𝒜 𝑖 of player 𝑖
∈ 𝒫
where
??

strategies. The expected utility of player 𝑖 over the vector of
all strategies, 𝒂 ∈ 𝒜

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS
In this section, numerical results are provided to study the
analytical solutions derived in Section III, for the two discussed
cases, through an application of the formulated game to the
WSCC 9-bus test system (system information available in [10]).
Throughout this section, two attackers and a defender are considered
with action spaces similar to the ones considered in
Subsection III-C. Since our main focus is on the attackers' and
defender's strategies, it is assumed that all market participants
abide by their DA schedules and, except for the attacks and
defense, no change in system conditions occur between DA and
RT. Hence, when no attacks are carried out, the RT LMPs are
similar to their DA counterparts.
A. Case One
In this case, line 6, connecting buses 7 and 8, and line 9,
connecting buses 4 and 9, are considered to be vulnerable lines.
Attacker 1 has virtual bids over buses 7 and 8 according to
which attacker 1 buys (sells) virtual power at bus 7 (bus 8) in
DA. In RT, attacker 1 must sell (buy) that same virtual power
at bus 7 (bus 8). On the other hand, attacker 2 places virtual
bids over buses 9 and 4. According to these virtual bids, in DA,

attacker 2 buys (sells) virtual power at bus 9 (bus 4), while in RT,
attacker 2 sells (buys) that same virtual power at bus 9 (bus 4).
As can be seen from Fig. 1, in case of no attacks, no congestion
takes place in the system. Hence, the LMPs across all buses are
equal and none of the attackers make any profit from their virtual
bids while the defender achieves its best utility. Having virtual
bids at buses 7 and 8, attacker 1 aims to cause a fake estimated
congestion over line 6, in RT, through data injection. As can be
seen in Fig. 1, under this attack, 𝜇 𝑅7? > 𝜇 𝑅8? which results in a
financial benefit to attacker 1 following from (25). However, this
attack results in a financial loss for attacker 2, since it results in
?? 𝑅9? < 𝜇 𝑅4? , and also causes a loss to the defender due to the
successful manipulation of RT LMPs. Attacker 2, on the other
hand, aims to create congestion over line 9. As can be seen
from Fig. 1, this attack results in a financial benefit for attacker
2, since 𝜇 𝑅9? > 𝜇 𝑅4? , but causes a financial loss to attacker
1, since 𝜇 𝑅8? > 𝜇 𝑅7? , and a loss to the defender. When both
attackers choose to launch their attacks, their combined effect on
the state estimation results causes no change in the system LMPs
in between DA and RT, as clearly shown in Fig.1, returning no
profit to the attackers while the defender achieves its best utility.
Hence, this case is an illustrative example on case 1 described
in Subsection III-C in which the game has a unique
PSNE consisting of both attackers choosing to attack and the
defender choosing not to take any defensive actions resulting in
(𝑈 0, 𝑈 1, 𝑈 2) = (0, −𝑐 1, −𝑐 2).
B. Case Two
In this case, attacker 1 buys (sells) virtual power at bus 6 (bus
5) in DA; whereas, in RT, it sells (buys) this same power at bus
6 (bus 5). Meanwhile, attacker 2 buys (sells) virtual power at
bus 9 (bus 8) in DA; whereas, in RT, it sells (buys) this same
power at bus 9 (bus 8). The corresponding LMPs at the different
buses under different attack strategies are shown in Fig. 2. The
DA results show congestion over line 3 (considered vulnerable)
connecting buses 5 and 6 resulting in 𝜇 𝐷5? > 𝜇 𝐷6? . Attacker 1
aims at removing this congestion in RT, through data injection,
which results in a financial benefit for attacker 1 since it leads to
?? 𝑅5? = 𝜇 𝑅6? = 0. As can be seen from Fig. 2, using this attack,
the congestion is removed in RT thus yielding constant LMPs at
all buses. From the virtual bidding strategies of attackers 1 and 2,
and following from (25), this attack results in a financial benefit
to attacker 1 but a financial loss to attacker 2, since 𝜇 𝐷9? > 𝜇 𝐷8?
and the resulting RT LMPs are such that 𝜇 𝑅9? = 𝜇 𝑅8? . Since this
2015 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm): Cyber Security and Privacy
attack leads to successful LMPs manipulation, it generates a loss
for the defender. On the other hand, in DA, there is no congestion
on vulnerable line 8 connecting buses 8 and 9. Attacker 2 aims
at creating an estimated congestion in RT over this line. As can
be seen from Fig. 2 and (25), through this attack, attacker 2
makes a financial benefit due to the manipulation of the LMPs
at buses 8 and 9, while attacker 1 also makes a profit since the
created congestion results in RT LMPs that yield 𝜁 1 > 0. Due to
successful LMPs manipulation by attacker 2, this attack creates a
loss for the defender. When both attackers choose to attack, their
attacks mitigate each others' effect thus resulting in no change
in LMPs in between DA and RT as can be seen in Fig. 2.
Hence, this case is analogous to case 2, analyzed in Subsection
III-C. We next investigate the attackers' and defender's
optimal strategies with respect to the cost of defense. This
analysis is carried out for 𝑐 0 ⩽ (𝑑 1𝑑 2)/(4(𝑑 1 + 𝑑 2)) which
corresponds to the range specified in Remark 1. For this range,
taking no defensive actions is not a PSNE. A similar analysis
can be carried out to show the effect of the costs of attack on
the MSNE but has been omitted here for space limitation.
Fig. 3 shows the variation of the equilibrium's mixed strategies
of the two attackers and the defender with respect to the cost of
defense. This figure shows that both attackers are more likely to
attack when the cost of defense increases. In fact, an increase in
?? 0 from $40 to $60 causes a twofold increase in the probability
of attack of any of the attackers. In contrast, the defender's
mixed strategy at the equilibrium is less sensitive to 𝑐 0. This
is due to the fact that the cost of defense, in the studied range,
is significantly smaller than the overall effect an attack has on
the system. For instance, attacker 1's successful attack yields
?? 0 = $720 for a total load, 𝑃 𝐿 = 315 MW. Hence, paying a
higher cost to defend the system is still beneficial to the defender.
In Fig. 4, we show the optimal expected utility of the defender
resulting from the derived MSNE. In this figure, the results are
compared to the expected utilities in the cases in which either
no defense is taken or the defender is equally likely to defend
either one of the attacked measurements. The expected utilities
are plotted as a function of the cost of defense. Since the defender
aims at minimizing its utility, as shown in (21), Fig. 4 shows
performance gains of the derived optimal defense strategy as
compared to the other strategies. For 𝑐 0 = $40, these gains reach
improvement up to 79% compared to the no defense strategy
and 85% compared to the uniform defense strategy. Moreover,
it also shows that it is better for the defender not to take any
defensive actions than to be equally likely to defend any of the
measurements. In addition, Fig. 4 shows, as expected, that the
defender has a worse expected utility when the cost of defense,
?? 0, increases which is clear from (21). In fact, a $20 increase
in 𝑐 0 (from $40 to $60) causes a $60 increase in the defender's
expected utility following the optimal defense strategy.
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have studied the problem of data injection
attacks on smart grid with multiple attackers. The strategic
interactions between the defender and the attackers have been
modeled using a noncooperative game in which costs of attack
and defense have been integrated in the utility functions of the
players. For the formulated game, we have derived the optimal

defense and attack strategies. Based on the obtained results, we
have shown that at equilibrium, under some attack schemes,
defensive actions are not needed to defend the system; whereas,
for other schemes, defense is needed to reduce the effect of
the attacks. Moreover, we have studied the effect of the cost of
defense on the attackers' and defender's optimal strategies and
utilities. Our results have provided valuable insights on how data
injection attacks with multiple adversaries can impact a smart
grid.
