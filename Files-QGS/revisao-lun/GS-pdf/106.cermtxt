Abstract-The security of power systems against malicious cyberphysical
data attacks becomes an important issue. The adversary
always attempts to manipulate the information structure of the power
system and inject malicious data to deviate state variables while
evading the existing detection techniques based on residual test. The
solutions proposed in the literature are capable of immunizing the
power system against false data injection but they might be too costly
and physically not practical in the expansive distribution network.
To this end, we define an algebraic condition for trustworthy power
system to evade malicious data injection. The proposed protection
scheme secures the power system by deterministically reconfiguring
the information structure and corresponding residual test. More
importantly, it does not require any physical effort in either microgrid
or network level. The identification scheme of finding meters being
attacked is proposed as well. Eventually, a well-known IEEE 30-bus
system is adopted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
schemes.

I. INTRODUCTION
P The trustworthy issue of the power system is of great
OWER system is the backbone of a country's economy.
crisis towards both human being's and industrial civilization.
In order to secure the power system, numerous meters are
deployed through power grids, including interconnected generation
plants, transmission lines, transformers and loads, to
attain updated state information. These information will be
provided to the control center or energy management system
(i.e. EMS) and analyzed for the prevention from unreliable factors.
Most of unreliability accounts for the false date injection,
which is usually induced by adversary or hardware failure. The
reliability level of system will be tremendously compromised
if such injection is not identified and accumulated, especially
when it is maliciously initiated by adversary [1][2]. In this
respect, research on the power system's protection and identification
scheme from malicious data injection is of theoretical
and practical interest.
Cyber-physical data attack attempts to deviate the accurate
data by introducing erroneous value into certain state variable.
Intuitively, such injection is able to be identified by comparing
the current state with the outcome of distributed estimation of
overall power grid [1][3][4]. The results merely demonstrated
that this detection scheme can identify attacks initiated by

random phenomena, such as measurement noise, hardware
failure or structure error. Recent research [2] indicated a certain
type of attack vector, under which the ordinary residualbased
scheme is rendered impotent. Apparently, adversary
successfully exploits the measurement matrix and manipulates
the state variables with malicious data injection composed by
a combination of vectors in the null space of P − I . In this
case, the residual remains unchanged, which fails ordinary bad
data detection (BDD). Further, the vulnerability of large-scale
power system to malicious data injection can not be omitted
due to the significant financial impact of such stealth attack
on electricity market [5]. To this end, a greedy algorithm
based protection scheme was proposed in [6], which aims
at deploying necessary amount secure meters at key buses
to ensure a reliable estimation and evade injection. Similar
work was introduced in [7] and [9], which illustrates how to
secure a state estimator from such injection by encrypting a
sufficient/minimum number of meters. The protection strategy
of [2] is extended further using a polynomial-time algorithm
in [8]. A generalized likehood ratio detection scheme (via
convex optimization) is introduced to defense such attack. In
addition, several countermeasures to these attacks were also
proposed, from additional protected measuring devices [10], to
the implementation of improved BDD schemes [2]. Methods
to efficiently rank the measurements in terms of their vulnerability
and finding sparse attacks requiring the corruption of a
low number of measurements were also proposed in [10], [11],
and [12]. In [13], a concept of load redistribution (LR) attacks,
a special type of false data injection attacks, was introduced
and analyzed regarding their damage to power system operation
in different time steps with different attacking resource
limitations.
From the power system's point of view, the solutions
mentioned above are surely functional but they might be
too expensive and not be physically practical for expansive
distributed network. In this paper, an enhanced protection
scheme against malicious false data injection is proposed.
An algebraic criterion is derived to ensure a trustworthy
power system against malicious cyber-physical data attacks.
The proposed protection scheme takes advantage of expansive
nature of power grids, reconfigures its subsystem data
structure deterministically, and makes it impossible to organize
a successful injection. The identification scheme for finding
meters being attacked is proposed as well. Then, analysis can
be further performed to remove the sources of malicious data
injection.

C. Existence of Malicious Data Attacks
In the case that an adversary has access to whole information
of H, he is able to launch a malicious attack to the
system such that the resulting corrupted state can avoid being
detected by the residual test in the sense that E < CT or
E ≈ 0. Following lemma shows how the adversary chooses
such a 'stealth' attack which is summarized in [2].
Lemma 2.1: ([2]) Let za ∈ Rm be amended coordinated
attack vector, which will be injected to original measurement
vector z in observation equation (2). za = Hc where c is
the corrupted state induced by the attack vector za. Let P =
H HT H −1 HT , where P is the projection of observation
matrix H ∈ Rm×n and clearly P H = H. All possible choices
of coordinated attack vector za ∈ Rm lie in the null space of
matrix (P − I), that is, (P − I)za = 0.
According to Lemma 2.1, the dimension of null space of
matrix (P − I) is n regarding the available measurements
in power grid. Note that in the power system, it is typical
that the number of meters m (both essential and redundant
measurements) are greater than number of state variables
n. The coordinated attack vectors za always exists if the
adversary can get access to all meters' data, power network
topology and line data of subsystem to construct H. The
attack vectors can be chosen to be a linear combination of the
vectors in the null space of (P − I). Secure meters' placement
can be considered as one methodology for preventing those
coordinated attack vectors and maintaining the subsystem in
normal status. However, it could be expensive and physically
impractical in expansive distribution network.
III. PROBLEM FORMULATION
A power system consists of electric generators, transmission
lines, and transformers that form an electrical network. We
consider a power system whose electric power grid can be
partitioned into a group of subsystems (shown in figure 1).
Monitoring the power flow and voltage of each subsystem is
important in maintaining system reliability. It is assumed that
the subsystem has the capability of reconfiguring its information
structure, performing state estimation, and reporting its
findings to the upper-level EMS (energy management system).

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II
provides a brief introduction of preliminary results. In section
III and IV, we present problem formulation and main results,
respectively, to explain how to protect the power system and
identify the meters being attacked with our enhanced schemes.
Then, an illustrative numerical example of IEEE 30-bus system
is elaborated in section V. Section VI concludes the paper and
points out the future direction.
II. PRELIMINARY RESULTS
A. State Estimation
The state estimation problem in power systems is to determine
the power system state variables such as voltage
angles and magnitudes at all system buses based on the meter
measurements. Given that the general measurement function
for the power system is
z = h(x) + e,
(1)
where x ∈ Rn is the overall state vector, z ∈ Rm is the overall
measurement vector and usually m > n, h(x) is the nonlinear
function derived from the power flow equations of the overall
power grid, and e ∈ Rm represents the measurement noise
whose covariance matrix is R. It is assumed that the system
(1) is observable that is a very well-established hypothesis for
any centralized algorithm of state estimation. The linearized
model of the measurement function (1) at time k is
z(k) = H(k)x(k) + e(k)
(2)
with a full-rank observation matrix H as rank(H) = n,
where rank(·) denotes the rank of matrix. The state estimation
problem under the assumption of global observability can be
formulated with standard WLS which is given by [14]
where xˆ is the estimate of state and
1
HT (k)R−1(k)H(k) − is the error covariance.
xˆ(k + 1) = xˆ(k) + K(k)H T (k)R−1(k) [z(k) − H(k)xˆ(k)] ,
(3)
K(k) =
B. Bad Data Detection
With the estimated state vector xˆ obtained by state estimation
algorithm (3), a common approach to verify the integrity
of state vector is by computing the L − norm of measurement ࡴ ൌ

estimated vector)

ࡴ ࢈ ൨
E = z − Hxˆ .
(4)
A threshold CT is pre-defined to control the tolerance of
residuals in terms of accuracy of state estimation. If measurement
residual is greater than the threshold value, i.e.,
E > CT , the measurement vector z has a bad data and
the state estimation algorithm is not convergent due to either
significant measurement/computation errors or gross false data
injections. Accordingly, analysis can be performed to position
where errors occurs and isolate the suspicious data sources.

(5)
where P1 and P2 is the projection matrix of H1 and H2,
respectively.
Proof: It is straightforward to see that, under condition (5),
the only admissible solution of attack vector is za = 0. In
other words, any attack vector rather than 0 yields a non-zero
residual even if the adversary knows H precisely.
It is worthy to note that the proposed method is employing
reconfiguration of observation matrix to secure the power
system from any attack, and it works as long as the power
system has sufficient redundancy to ensure the observability
for the sub-areas represented by H1 and H2. The proof for the
feasibility of finding sub-matrices H1 and H2 will be provided
in the next section.
IV. MAIN RESULTS
In this section, we will first present the feasibility of finding
sub-matrices H1 and H2 for H, and then the protection and
identification schemes for power systems against malicious
data attacks.
Recall the property of Idempotent Matrix in [15], it is
straightforward to see that P1 and P2 are both idempotent.
Thus, I − P1 and I − P2 are idempotent as well. Let us define
A = P1 − I and C = P2 − I, then the following facts are
obvious:
Fact 4.1: −A and −C are idempotent. Also,
A2 = −A, C2 = −C, (−A) = −A,
where denotes the generalized inverse of a matrix.
Fact 4.2: P1 is the projection matrix of H1,
trace(P1) = rank(P1) = rank(H1)
where trace(·) denotes the trace of a matrix.
Based on the above facts, we have the following proposition.

Then, we are ready to present the first main result as follows.

(13)
Thus,
rank(C − CA A) = rank(Ha) = rank(H1).
(14)
It finalizes the proof by also noticing that both H1 and H2 are
required to be full rank n.
Theorem 4.5 provides a mathematical solution to find the
sub-matrices H1 and H2 such that eq. (5) holds. Together with
Proposition 3.1, it also manifests that reconfiguring information
structure and corresponding residual test are capable of
securing the power system against malicious data attacks.
Remark 4.6: It is worth noting that rank(
) = m − n
if and only if Ha = 0l×n. It implies that any row elimination
of H will contribute the increase of rank. Until eliminating
Ha with rank n, the full rank will be met. Also note that the
full-rank requirement of H1 and H2 leads to n ≤ l ≤ m − n,
which also indicates sufficient measures are required in the
sense that m ≥ 2n.
In what follows, an innovative protection scheme based on
Proposition 3.1 and Theorem 4.5 is proposed in figure 2 for
power system to enhance the security against malicious data
attacks. It is a purely mathematical approach and does not
require any physical effort either microgrid or network level
in comparison with existing work.
Vice verse, the identification scheme is also right on hand
based on Proposition 3.1 and Theorem 4.5. The meters that
are being attacked by malicious data attack can be identified
through the calculation of attack vector z¯a given the residual
vectors r1 and r2 generated by two sub-areas H1 and H2,
z¯a = (P¯T P¯)−1P¯T r1 ,

attacked. Further analysis can be performed to remove the
sources of malicious data attack. The procedure of identification
can be found in figure 3.
The performance of the proposed protection and identification
schemes will be illustrated in the next section.

Note that m = 86 > 58 = 2n guarantees the sufficient
redundancy of measurements which is required in Theorem
4.5. It can be obtained that rank(P − I ) = 57 < 86 and
hence there are 29 linearly independent choices of coordinated
attack vectors. In other words, 29 attack vectors are available
to be used for injecting malicious data to corrupt the state
estimation. By inspecting the null space of P − I , the data
attack vectors za which correspond to 86 meters are given in
table I: (partial data has been omitted due to the limited space)

TABLE I
CHOICES OF MALICIOUS DATA ATTACK VECTORS
The adversary can choose any linear combination of these
29 non-zero attack vectors to inject malicious data and obviously
(P − I )za = 0 holds. For more clarification, assume
that the adversary is injecting za1 to real measurement z. As
we discussed earlier, this type of coordinated attack will not
be detected by the residual test since
E1 =
z + za1 − H x¯
= 3.1187 × 10−14
which is almost zero and will be surely smaller than the predefined
threshold CT .
Next, the proposed schemes will be implemented for the
illustration of effectiveness. What is more, the statistical analysis
will be adopted to verify the equivalence between standard
WLS state estimation and batch state estimation induced by
our scheme.
A. Protection
By noticing the fact that there always exits malicious data
attack vectors for the current system, we then follow the
protection scheme depicted in Fig. 2 to secure the system.
Via row operation, two sub-matrices H1 and H2 can be found
by excluding 29 essential meters (independent rows) from the
observation matrix H and setting zero for rest of the rows in
each of them: (partial data has been omitted due to the limited
space)

be: (partial data has been omitted due to the limited space)

P1 − I
P2 − I
which validates the Theorem 4.5. Together with Proposition
3.1, it reveals that this reconfiguration of power system and
corresponding residual test are able to secure the modified
IEEE 30-bus system from any malicious data attack.
For more clarification, the following residual test is performed
when the same attack vector za1 is applied:
or
E21 = z + za − H1x¯1 = 1.2063,
1
E22 = z + za − H2x¯2 = 1.0893,
1
which is obviously easier to be detected with the pre-defined
threshold CT comparing to residual test E1. It can be observed
that the malicious attack vectors are no longer 'stealth' within
the proposed protection scheme such that the effectiveness of
proposed protection scheme is validated.

C. Statistical Analysis
For the estimation's purpose, the estimation algorithm under
the proposed strategies turns out to be a two-batch estimation
algorithm since we partition the whole system by two. Essentially,
it is important to see the batch estimation is as good
as the standard WLS estimation algorithm from the statistical
perspective. Thus, the following covariance analysis from [17]
is needed:
Cov(xˆ, xˆ) = σ2(HT H)−1
where the σ2 is a variance of measurement error.
Assume that the xˆ1 is the estimation of the state variables
using H1 and xˆ2 is the estimation of the state variables using
H2. It is natural to realize that the estimation of two-batch
algorithm xˆ¯ is the average of these two state estimations. Then,
the covariance of two-batch estimation algorithm is calculated
as below
Cov(xˆ¯, xˆ¯) = Cov(
xˆ1 + xˆ2 xˆ1 + xˆ2
,
2 2
)
= 1 σ2(H1T H1)−1 + 1 σ2(H2T H2)−1.
4 4
For illustrating the equivalence of two algorithms, the wellknown
Frobenius norm [18] is needed to test the equality of
these two covariance matrices
d2 = 1 trace(Cov(xˆ, xˆ) − Cov(xˆ¯, x¯ˆ))2
n
where d is the distance between two covariance matrices, n is
the number of states. It is clear that if two covariance matrices
is exactly the same, i.e., Cov(xˆ, xˆ) = Cov(xˆ¯, xˆ¯), then d = 0.
Through the calculation,
d2 = 1 trace(Cov(xˆ¯, x¯ˆ) − Cov(xˆ, xˆ))2 = 0.2425
29
=⇒ d = 0.4925
which indicates the approximate equivalence between two
algorithms.
