Blind False Data Injection Attack Using PCA
Approximation Method in Smart Grid
Zong-Han Yu and Wen-Long Chin
Abstract-Accurate state estimation is of paramount importance
to maintain normal operations of smart power grids.
However, recent research shows that carefully produced attacks
with the knowledge of the grid topology, i.e., Jacobian matrix, can
bypass the bad data detection (BDD) system. The BDD is used to
ensure the integrity of state estimation to filter faulty measurements
introduced by device malfunctions or malicious attacks.
However, to construct the false data injection attack vectors, a
common assumption in most prior works on false data injection
attacks is that the attacker has complete knowledge about the
power grid topology and transmission-line admittances. By contrast,
this paper studies the general problem of blind false data
injection attacks using the principal component analysis approximation
method without the knowledge of Jacobian matrix and
the assumption regarding the distribution of state variables. The
proposed attack is proven to be approximately stealthy.1 The performance
of the proposed attack is analyzed. Simulations confirm
the performance of the proposed method.

ciency and reliability of power grids [1]. The smart grid [2], [3]
envisions an interconnected power distribution network that
streamlines transmission, distribution, monitoring, and control
of electricity by allowing two-way communication and flow
of power [4]. Smart grid security encompasses protection of
both the communication network and the power grid, because
these two systems need to ensure availability of access as
well as survivability under threats [5], [6]. If the state information
of the grid were maliciously altered, the grid could
destabilize with potential for physical damage [7]. Therefore,
state estimation [8]-[13] is a key function in building real-time
models of electricity networks in energy management centers.
Based on the integrated infrastructure and two-way communication,
the risk and vulnerability in the power grid have
increased [8]-[10]. The strong coupling between cyber and
physical operations makes power systems vulnerable to cyber

attacks. For example, information of the electric power system
will be transmitted on the network, and the information
may interest parties who want to harm the utility or its customers.
Current power systems are continuously monitored
and controlled by energy management system and supervisory
control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems in order
to maintain the operating conditions in a normal and secure
state [14].
To ensure the integrity of state estimation, current power
grid systems employ the bad data detection (BDD) to filter
faulty measurements caused by device malfunctions or malicious
attacks. The threat of false data injection attack is an
important issue for the success of smart grid [10], [15]. The
power system uses the BDD system to detect the random errors
caused by device malfunctions, telemetry failure, and communication
noise. As the power grid becomes more complicated
than before, there will be plenty of ways through the integrated
communication network to attack the power system. Owing to
arising new vulnerability in the system, the BDD system may
not be able to protect the system thoroughly.
To construct the false data injection attack vectors, a common
assumption in most prior works on false data injection
attacks is that the attacker has complete knowledge about
the power grid topology and transmission-line admittances.
However, it is more practical than prior works by the case
of knowing limited information regarding the power network
topology or admittance for some transmission lines [16].
In [16], a successful false data attack with limited information
is described. By contrast, this paper studies the problem of
blind false data injection attacks without explicit knowledge
of the power grid topology and makes inferences from the correlations
of the line measurements, while the countermeasures
for the proposed attacks are outside the scope of this paper.
The dc power flow model [17], which considers the voltage
angles of all buses as state variables, is utilized in this paper. In
practice, a nonlinear state estimator is often used. We demonstrate
that, under the nonlinear ac power flow model, effective
attack vectors can still be generated by the proposed method.
Though distributed implementation is possible, we focus on
centralized attack carried out by breaking into the SCADA
system in the utility control center.
The proposed method utilizes the principal component
analysis (PCA) [18] approximation method to transform the
observation vector into a linear combination of a vector with
uncorrelated components, which can be regarded as the product
of the PCA matrix and observation vector. The PCA matrix
obtained by the PCA can be also viewed as the product of the

Jacobian matrix of the power grid with a projection matrix.
The attack vector generated by the PCA matrix is proven to be
approximately stealthy. Approximation of the PCA matrix is
introduced by the dimensionality reduction of PCA to conform
to the dimension of the original Jacobian matrix. Because it
is arguable to make any assumption about the distribution of
state variables, the state variables of the electrical grids for the
proposed attack can be any random variables with unknown
distributions, including both Gaussian and non-Gaussian distributed
random variables. For fixed or real state variables,
the proposed method can also function very well. The performance
of the proposed attack is analyzed using the extreme
value theory [19]. Simulation results confirm the advantages
of the proposed blind and stealthy attack.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II
presents related works. Section III introduces the system
model, state estimation, and BDD. Section IV then describes
the conventional false data injection attack. Next, Section V
gives the basic principles of PCA and the proposed blind false
data injection attack. Section VI analyzes the performance of
BDD against the proposed attack. Section VII summarizes the
simulation results. The conclusion and future works are finally
drawn in Section VIII.
II. RELATED WORKS
an attacker that compromises the communication infrastructure
of a single control center can successfully perform a
denial-of-service attack. A new mechanism, named data framing
attack, aimed at misleading a power system control center
about the source of a data attack is proposed [9]. The proposed
attack frames meters that are providing correct data as
sources of bad data such that the control center will remove
useful measurements that would otherwise be used by the state
estimator.
Defending mechanisms against false data injection attacks
by protecting a few carefully selected measurements are
studied [15], [26], [27]. They show both optimum and reducedcomplexity
algorithms for protecting the data integrity and
demonstrate it by physical experiments. Huang et al. [26] presented
an adaptive cumulative sum algorithm to address the
quick detection against the false data issue. The vulnerability
of ac state estimation is assessed in [28] and [29] with respect
to false data injection cyber-attacks. Bi and Zhang [10] provided
an approach to defend against false data injection attacks
using covert power network topological information.

resistance in the transmission line connecting buses i and j is
small compared to its reactance, the active power-flow model
from bus i to bus j can be expressed as [30]

Here, H is an m × n matrix. The matrix H is a full rank
matrix to allow the estimation of x from z [31]. Without loss
of generality, we further assume m ≥ n. Thus, rank (H) = n.
According to (6), the maximum-likelihood estimation of x can
be determined by [31]

γ is the decision threshold, and ri, i = 1, 2, . . . , m,
denotes the elements of r.
IV. CONVENTIONAL FALSE DATA INJECTION ATTACK
Under the condition of perfect knowledge of the Jacobian
matrix, an attacker can inject a vector a resulting in the new
measurements za = z + a, where a and za are m × 1 vectors,
to masquerade as the original measurements z = Hx + v.
According to [15], an attack can be achieved with
where c = (c1, c2, . . . , cn)T is an arbitrary n × 1 nonzero
vector. Doing so makes the residue
ra = za − Hxˆa = z + a − H xˆ + c
= z − Hxˆ + (a − Hc) = z − Hxˆ
where xˆa = (HT WH)−1HT Wza = xˆ + c is a n × 1 vector
and represents the state estimate from the new measurement
(under attack) za, and xˆ denotes the state estimate from
the original measurement (without attack) z. As indicated
by (8) and (11), the attack has the same residue as that without
attack. Therefore, the attack is stealthy and expected to
have the same probability of missed detection as that without
attack, whose performance is mainly influenced by the
statistical properties of the measurement noise vector v.
V. PROPOSED BLIND FALSE DATA INJECTION ATTACK
A. Basic Principles of PCA
Before delving into the proposed method, the basic principles
of PCA are introduced. The PCA is a statistical analysis
of data in an effective way by reducing the dimensions of
a given unlabeled high-dimensional dataset while keeping its
spatial characteristics as much as possible. More specifically,
the PCA transforms the dataset into a new coordinate system
such that the projection onto it has the greatest variance among
all possible projections. By finding the successive coordinates
(or principal components), we can visualize the distribution of
the original dataset after projecting it onto a low-dimensional
space [18].
Based on the original dataset (or random vector) z and
its realization (or observed vector) zi, i = 1, 2, . . . , d,
where d denotes the number of observed vectors and zi is
an m × 1 vector. The sample mean vector of z is μz =
1/d id=1 zi. The goal of PCA is to find a unity vector
p˜1 = ( p˜11, p˜12, . . . , p˜1m)T such that the squared sum of the
projection onto this direction is the maximum. Let the dataset
z = z − μz, which has a zero mean vector μz = 0m×1. Let
Zm×d = (z1, z2, . . . , zd), the projection of each column of Z
onto p˜ 1 can be written as
pd×1 = ⎢
⎣
T
⎡ z 1 p˜1 ⎤
.
.. ⎥ = Z T p˜ 1
T ⎦
z d p˜1
(12)
where z iT p˜1 represents the projection of zi onto p˜1.
Normalized by d, the square sum of the projection is a function
of p˜ 1 and can be denoted by
J(p) = d1 |p|2 = d1 pT p = d1 p˜1T Z Z T p˜ 1 = p˜ 1T z p˜ 1 (13)
where the sample covariance matrix z = 1/d id=1(zi μz
)(zi − μz )T = 1/dZ Z T is an m × m matrix. Notably, the
sample covariance matrix of z, z, is the same as z . To
maximize J(p) under the constraint | p˜1| = 1, one can use the
Lagrange multiplier to form a new objective function
a = Hc
(10)
J˜ (p, λ1) = p˜ 1 z p˜ 1 + λ1 1 − p˜ 1T p˜1 .
T
(14)
J (p) = λ1.
λ1 > λ2 > · · · > λm
of
Without loss of generality, one can arrange the eigenvalues
z into a descending order
with the corresponding eigenvectors p˜ 1, p˜2, . . . , p˜ m. Then, the
maximum value of J (p) is λ1, which occurs at p˜1, while the
second maximum is λ2, which occurs at p˜ 2, and so on.
Once we have found the first principal component x˜1 = p˜1T z
as the projection onto the unity eigenvector corresponding
to the maximum eigenvalue of z , we can continue to find
the second principal component x˜2 = p˜ 2T z that achieves the
maximum projection onto p˜2 with the constraint that p˜2 is
orthogonal to p˜ 1. To this end, the objective function
J˜1 (p, ρ1, ρ2) = p˜2 z p˜ 2 + ρ1 1 − p˜2T p˜2 + ρ2 p˜2T p˜ 1
T
(18)
is maximized by differentiating it respect to p˜2, which can be
found that the solution p˜ 2 is also an eigenvector of z with
eigenvalue λ2. By repeating this process, one can obtain the
successive principal components as the projection onto orthogonal
eigenvectors p˜ 1, p˜ 2, . . . , p˜ m of z . Notable, since z is
symmetric, its eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis with
p˜iT p˜ j = 0, ∀i = j.
The steps for the PCA operation are summarized here. First,
the sample mean vector, μz, of the dataset z is obtained.
Second, since z = z, the sample covariance matrix z is
calculated. Third, find the eigenvalues of z and arrange them
into descending order (λ1, λ2, . . . , λm), with eigenvectors
( p˜1, p˜ 2, . . . , p˜ m). Finally, the transformation matrix

is an m × m matrix and used to transform z into x˜ as

diag(λ1, λ2, . . . , λm). If one only wants to keep n dimensions,
n ≤ m, then simply put n eigenvectors into P˜ .
B. Blind Derivation of the PCA Matrix Using PCA

attacks without prior knowledge of the power grid topology
and makes inferences from the correlations of the line measurements.
We focus on the problems of identifying the impact
of malicious cyber attacks on state estimation, by recognizing

Differentiate J˜(p, λ1) with respect to p˜1 and set it to zero, the key role of state estimation as the interface between cyber
one has and physical operations in a smart grid.
The PCA is a mathematical procedure that uses orthogonal
z p˜1 = λ1p˜ 1. (15) transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly corIt
is obvious that the solution p˜1 of (15) is an eigenvector related variables z into a set of linearly uncorrelated variables,
of z with eigenvalue λ1. Under this condition x˜, called principal components. Or, equivalently, (20) can be
written as

(25)
(16)
(17)
(19)
(20)
z =
PT −1
˜
x˜ = P˜ x˜
because eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis.
The PCA algorithm maximizes the variance of principal components
to reduce the dimension of a data set, which indicates
that the first principal component has the largest eigenvalue λ1.
The sample variance of x˜i = p˜iT z can be shown to be
var (x˜i) = p˜iT zp˜ i = p˜ iT z p˜ i = λip˜ iT p˜i = λi
(22)
where the third equality holds because of (15). Hence, this
transformation is defined in such a way that the first principal
component has the largest variance, the second principal
component has the second largest variance, and so on.
Generally, the ith principal component can be given as
x˜i = p˜iT z.
By the PCA, the number of principal components can be
less than the number of original variables, which is named
the dimensionality reduction. In smart grid, owing to the
dimension of the Jacobian matrix, we propose to use the
number of state variables, n, as the number of principal components.
Hence, dropping those nonprincipal components, x˜i
for n < i ≤ m, with small variances or eigenvalues of z, and
according to (21), z can be approximated by

where the dimensionality reduction version of P˜ , i.e., the PCA
matrix HPCA, is an m × n matrix and will be used for the new
topology matrix, and xPCA is a n × 1 vector.
Next, the relation between x and xPCA is obtained.
Proposition 1:
x ≈ PxxPCA
where Px = H+HPCA is a n × n projection matrix of principal
components xPCA to original state variables x, and
H+ is a n × m matrix and denotes the pseudoinverse of H
(see the Appendix A). Notably, x ≈ PxxPCA = xPCA. The
relation between x, xPCA, and z can be described using the
vector projection in Fig. 1.

C. Blind Stealthy Attack
Ignore measurement noise, the measurements can be represented
as
(26)
(27)
(28)
Comparing (24) with (26), the PCA matrix
z = Hx ≈ HPxxPCA.
HPCA ≈ HPx
which indicates that HPCA can be approximately expressed as
the product of the original topology matrix H and Px. Based
on HPCA, the proposed attack is formulated. Before that, the
following theorem is introduced.
Theorem 1: The proposed attack using the m × 1 attack
vector
aPCA = HPCAc
where c is an arbitrary n × 1 nonzero vector, is almost stealthy
when the PCA matrix HPCA can be approximately written as
the product of the original Jacobian matrix and another matrix,
say Px, i.e., HPCA ≈ HPx (see the Appendix B).
The phrase “almost stealthy” is used to emphasize that
the residue is approximately the same as that without attack,
which occurs because of (27), i.e., owing to the dimensionality
reduction used to conform to the dimension of the original
Jacobian matrix H. The PCA matrix HPCA is merely an
approximation of P˜ .
The proposed algorithm is displayed in Algorithm 1. Based
on HPCA obtained using the PCA algorithm, the stealthy attack
vector za,PCA is generated for the blind false data injection
attack. One may ask whether an arbitrary m × n matrix, for
example, H , can be expressed as the product of the Jacobian
matrix H and another n × n matrix P , i.e., H = HP . The
answer is no, because H has the full column rank. On the
contrary, if H has the full row rank, since HH+ = Im×m,
YU AND CHIN: BLIND FALSE DATA INJECTION ATTACK USING PCA APPROXIMATION METHOD IN SMART GRID
1223
H = HH+H = HP , where P = H+H . Hence, in this
case, an arbitrary matrix can be expressed as the product
of H and another matrix P , and can be used to generate
undetectable attacks, which is certainly not the case in the
considered scenario.
It should be noted that the expectation of residue
E[ra,PCA] = (HPCA − HPx)c = 0m×1, which depends on the
value of c and the difference between HPCA and HPx. If c
Fig. 1. Relation between x, xPCA, and z described using the vector projection. is an arbitrary vector, the smaller (HPCA − HPx), the more
stealthy for the proposed attack. Additionally, the covariance
matrix Cov(ra,PCA) = (I − G) v(I − G)T , which is the same
as the covariance of residue without any attack.

VI. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
The asymptotic cumulative distribution function (cdf) of the
extreme value (9) of the residue r, that is
rmax = max {|r1| , |r2| , . . . , |rm|}
has a function of the type [19]
Frmax (γ ) = e−e−α(γ −β)
where Frmax (γ ) = P(rmax ≤ γ ) denotes the cdf of rmax, P (·)
denotes the probability, e(·) denotes the exponential function,
and α and β are parameters of the cdf. If statistical samples
of rmax are available, then these parameters may be estimated
so that the theoretical mean value and variance of the distribution
match the sample mean and sample variance. To use this
moment-matching method of parameter estimation, one needs
expressions for the mean μ and variance σ 2 in terms of the
parameters as
μ = β + 0.5α77
σ 2 = 1.α6245 .
Based on μ and σ 2, α and β can be determined. Notably,
the above cdf of the extreme value of the residue can be used
for other unknown distributions of v supposed that the probability
density of v decays in the upper tail as an exponential
function. The upper tail of the Rayleigh distribution of |ri|
actually decays as an exponential function.
Finally, based on the cdf, the probability of missed detection,
Pmiss ≡ P(maxi |ri| < γ |H1), can be expressed as
Pmiss = Frmax (γ )
where P(·|H1) denotes the probability of a random variable
conditioned on H1.
VII. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to assess the performance
of the proposed attack using different network
topologies, which are obtained using MATPOWER [33]. The
measurements consist of the power injection measurements
at all buses and the power flows at all branches. First, the
simulation results are conducted on the IEEE 14-Bus electrical
grid model [34], as shown in Fig. 2. There are 54
measurements in the IEEE 14-Bus model. The impacts of
measurement noise with zero mean Gaussian distribution are

also evaluated. The signal-to-measurement noise ratio is 10
dB. For the conventional false data injection attack, the state
vector becomes xa = x + c, where the elements of c are
randomly generated by a Gaussian random variable with variance
σc2. In this case, the signal-to-measurement noise ratio
is defined as 10log(σx2a /σv2), where σx2a = σx2 + σc2, σx2a and
σx2 denote the variances of the elements of xa and x, respectively,
and 10log(σc2/σx2) = 3 dB, i.e., the variance of the state
vector contributed by the injected vector is assumed to be
3 dB higher than that contributed by the original measurement
data. For other attacks, the signal-to-measurement noise
ratio is similarly defined. If there is no false data, c = 0n×1
and σc2 = 0; hence, the signal-to-measurement noise ratio
10log(σx2a /σv2) = 10log(σx2/σv2). Because it is arguable to
make any assumption about the distribution of state variables,
the state variables of the electrical grids for the proposed
attack can be any random variables with unknown distributions,
including both independent Gaussian and non-Gaussian
distributed random variables. Three kinds of state variable
distribution are considered for the IEEE 14-Bus: 1) all are
non-Gaussian; 2) all are Gaussian; and 3) mixing Gaussian
and non-Gaussian. For fixed state variables during a period of
time, the proposed method can also function very well, and
hence, its simulation results are omitted here.

γ for the measurement without attacks (ideal), conventional
attack with perfect knowledge of Jacobian matrix (perfect),
random attack (random), and the proposed attack using the
PCA approximation method (PCA Sim.). The state variables
are all non-Gaussian and uniformly distributed. For other nonGaussian
random variables, similar results can be observed;
therefore, they are omitted here for clarity. As shown, the
random attack without taking the Jacobian matrix into consideration
has the lowest Pmiss; hence, it is not stealthy. As
expected, the performance of the perfect attack coincides with
that of the ideal condition; therefore, the perfect attack is
indeed a stealthy and perfect attack. In addition, the performance
of the proposed PCA attack can approach those of the
ideal condition and perfect attack with perfect knowledge of
Jacobian matrix, and has a much better performance than that
of the random attack. Hence, the proposed attack is considered
to be almost stealthy. Moreover, the theoretical result
(PCA Ana.) matches the simulation result of the proposed
method very well, which further confirms the advantages of
the proposed attack.

state variable in Fig. 5 is mixing 50% Gaussian and 50% nonGaussian
random variables. As presented, the proposed PCA
attack is robust to various distributions of state variables and
its performance can still approach that of the ideal condition
and perfect attack with perfect knowledge of Jacobian matrix.
Besides, comparing Figs. 3-5, the performance of the proposed
PCA attack is only slightly affected by the distributions
of state variables.
Next, the simulation results are conducted on the IEEE
14-Bus and 300-Bus electrical grid models [34], as shown
in Figs. 6 and 7, respectively. The IEEE 300-Bus model has
1122 meters. The state vector is typically correlated in power
grids. Therefore, we use the data generated by MATPOWER
which reflects a more realistic simulation environment. The
attack vector is constructed based on the dc power flow model.
Once constructed, the attack vector is added to the noisy measurements.
Notice that the attack vector is designed based on
the dc power flow model, which has only the real part of
the measurements. As shown in these figures, the proposed
method is also effective for the real data in large and small
electric grids. To evaluate the effects of the nonlinearity of
the PCA ac, as shown in Figs. 6 and 7, the performance of
the PCA ac degrades owing to the introduced nonlinearity, but
its performance is still better than that of the random attack.
Compared to PCA dc, the performance of the PCA ac degrades
more for a large system than a smaller one. However, to the
best of our knowledge, the perfect attack for the ac power flow
model has still not been developed in literature. In the case
of correlated state vectors, the correlated state vector x can be
projected to an independent vector y with x = Dy, where D
is an n × n matrix and the eigenvectors of x. Thus, the model
becomes z = Hx = HDy = H y, where H = HD denotes the
Jacobian matrix used for the case of independent vectors. The
PCA matrix becomes HPCA ≈ H Px. Therefore, the proposed
method can generally be applied for correlated state vectors.
VIII. CONCLUSION
Conventional false data injection attack assumes the explicit
knowledge of the Jacobian topology matrix. Besides, it is
arguable that the distribution of the state variables is Gaussian
or not; therefore, this paper proposes a stealthy and blind
attack without the knowledge of the Jacobian matrix and
any assumption about the distribution of state variables.
Additionally, the proposed method can also be applied for the
real and fixed state variables. The performance of the proposed
attack approaches those without attack and attack with perfect
knowledge of Jacobian matrix. This type of new blind attacks
opens a potential research direction, and deserves much attention
to prevent the power grids from being masqueraded. Our
future research direction will focus on the attacks constrained
to a set of meters, limited resources, and specific states.
ra,PCA = za,PCA − Hxˆa,PCA
= z + aPCA − H xˆ + Pxc
= z − Hxˆ + (aPCA − HPxc)
≈ z − Hxˆ + (aPCA − HPCAc)
= z − Hxˆ.
Therefore, the new attack is almost stealthy, because its
residue is approximately the same as that without attack. The
proof follows.
Ignoring measurement noise in (6) and equating it with (24)

Since, H has the full column rank
hence, Px = H+HPCA. The proof follows.

Under the proposed attack, the new m × 1 measurement
vector za,PCA = z + aPCA gives the state estimate xˆa,PCA =
(HT WH)−1HT Wza,PCA = xˆ + Pxc, where xˆa,PCA is a n × 1
vector. Therefore, the residue of the proposed blind attack
under the attack vector za,PCA is written as
