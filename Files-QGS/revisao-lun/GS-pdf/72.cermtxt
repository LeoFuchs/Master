Abstract- This paper considers a method of coding the
sensor outputs in order to detect stealthy false data injection
attacks. An intelligent attacker can design a sequence of data
injection to sensors that pass the state estimator and statistical
fault detector, based on knowledge of the system parameters.
To stay undetected, the injected data should increase the state
estimation errors while keep the estimation residues in a small
range. We employ a coding matrix to the original sensor outputs
to increase the estimation residues, such that the alarm will be
triggered by the detector even under intelligent data injection
attacks. This is a low cost method compared with encryption
over sensor communication networks. We prove the conditions
the coding matrix should satisfy under the assumption that the
attacker does not know the coding matrix yet. An iterative
optimization algorithm is developed to compute a feasible
coding matrix, and, we show that in general, multiple feasible
coding matrices exist.
I. INTRODUCTION
Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) integrate computation and
communications to interact with physical processes. Many
applications are considered as CPSs, including high confidence
medical devices, energy conservation, environmental
control, and safety critical infrastructures-such as water supply
systems, electric power, and communication systems [1].
Therefore, security is a critical aspect of these systems, and
CPSs involve additional challenges in control layer. The
problem of secure control is defined, and defenses from
information security, sensor network security are analyzed
in [2]. However, due to the interaction of cyber systems with
physical world, these mechanisms alone are not sufficient for
the security of CPSs [2].
The reasons that CPSs are vulnerable to cyber attacks and
key challenges are summarized in [3]. Novel attack-detection
algorithms besides existing information protection methods
in cyber security area can be designed, by understanding
how attacks affect state estimation and control of the system.
Stealthy attacks from an intelligent attacker that can access
a partial model of the system are synthesized in [4], and
tools to protect state-estimation components in CPSs are developed.

unencrypted communication channels in power grids [5], the
authors developed two algorithms to maximize the utility of
encrypted devices placed to increase system security.
Fault detection, isolation and reconfiguration (FDIR)
methods have been explored to ensure system safety requirements
and robustness [6]. Although active techniques have
been designed to tackle various types of attacks, fundamental
limitations still exist, as characterized in [7]. Fawzi et al.
propose estimation and control schemes of noise free linear
systems, when some of the sensors or actuators are corrupted
in [8]. Pajic et al. present a robust state estimation method
in presence of attacks to no more than half of the sensors
for systems with noise and modeling errors [9]. In contrast,
we assume a different case where the attacker can inject an
arbitrary vector to the communication between sensors and
the estimator/detector/controller block, thus no element of
the injection vector is constrained to be zero.
In this work, we consider a type of deceptive cyber attackfalse
data injection attacks to sensor outputs. We assume
that there is no physical attack on individual measurements
or sensors. The monitoring system can detect malicious
behaviors in general. Miao et al. design a stochastic game
approach for replay attacks detection when the system is
equipped with an active controller, a filter and a statistical
detector [10]. However, with knowledge of the system model,
an intelligent cyber attacker is able to carefully design
a data injection sequence, such that the state estimation
error increases without triggering the alarm of the monitor
[11], [12]. It is also shown that by only compromising
actuators, attackers can never introduce infinite estimation
errors that passing a monitor like 2 detector [12]. Therefore,
we focus on intelligent sensor false data injection attacks
and assume actuators are secure in this paper. Regarding
the computational overhead of encryptions on embedded
architectures [13], we propose an alternative low cost method
to code the sensor measurements for detection.
The main contribution of this work is a low cost method
of coding sensor outputs to detect stealth sensor false data
injection attacks. We assume that the coding matrix is
secured, sent to sensors by a side channel before the coding
starts. We show that even if the attacker knows the system
model without the coding scheme, the system can detect
the original stealthy sensor injections by coding the sensor
outputs according to certain conditions. We also design an
iterative optimization algorithm to compute such coding
matrices, and show that in general, multiple feasible coding
matrices exist. By encrypting only the coding matrix channel
once, the coding approach saves encryption cost compared
with encrypting all sensor outputs. Results presented in this

work also provide a basis for the analysis of situations where
the attacker can learn the coding scheme in some steps. In
this case, the system can either change a new coding matrix
or randomly use a set of coding matrices to fool the attacker.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section II we
describe the system and attack models. The conditions that
a feasible coding matrix should satisfy are presented in Section
III, with a proof in Appendix. An iterative optimization
algorithm to find a feasible coding matrix is developed in
Section IV. Section V shows illustrative examples. Conclusions
are given in Section VI.
II. SYSTEM AND ATTACK MODEL
We will introduce the normal system model and deception
attack model in this section. The system architecture with
a discrete-time linear time-invariant (LTI) system and false
data injection attack to sensors is shown in Figure 1.
A. Linear system model
Assume the CPS is a discrete time LTI system with the
following form:
xk+1 = Axk + Buk + wk;
yk = Cxk + vk;
(1)
where xk 2 Rn is the system state vector at time k, uk 2 Rm
is the control input at time k, and yk 2 Rp is the sensor
observation vector. We do not have specific restrictions for
the linear control input uk here, and we will illustrate why the
controller does not affect the detection of false data injection
later. We assume wk N (0; Q) and vk N (0; R), are
identical independent Gaussian noises and initial state of the
system satisfies x0 N (0; ).
The optimal Kalman filter used to estimate state x^kjk is:
x^0j 1 = 0;
P0j 1 =
Pk+1jk = APkAT + Q;
Kk+1 = Pk+1jkCT (CPk+1jkCT + R) 1;
; x^k+1jk = Ax^k + Buk;
Pk+1 = (I
zk+1 = yk+1
Kk+1C)Pk+1jk;
C(Ax^k + Buk); x^k+1 = x^k+1jk + Kkzk+1:
Under the assumption that (A; B) is stabilizable, (A; C) is
detectable, we get a steady state Kalman filter, with the error

covariance matrix P and Kalman gain matrix K:
P , lim Pkjk 1; K , P CT (CP CT + R) 1:
k!1
By the property of Kalman filter, matrix (A KCA) is stable.
Here zk+1 is the estimation residue. Without attacks, residue
zk follows a Gaussian distribution N (0; CP CT + R).
Define the quantities gk as: gk = zkT P 1zk, where P 1 is
the error covariance matrix of Kalman filter, then gk satisfies
a 2 distribution with p degrees of freedom. By using gk,
we consider the standardized residue sequence k = P 21 zk
for a monitoring system-a 2 failure detector, and assume
there exists a such that limk!1 kE kk . We denote
as the threshold for the alarm, meaning that the alarm is
triggered when gk > .
B. False data injection attack model
In this paper, we assume that actuators are secure and
only consider the case of sensor attacks. It has been shown
that by only compromising actuators, attackers can never
induce infinite estimation error without being detected under
monitoring systems like a 2 detector [12]. Therefore, we
focus on intelligent sensor false data injection in this paper.
The system model under attack is described as:
x0k+1 = Ax0k + Bu0k + wk; yk0 = Cx0k + yka + vk;
(2)
where ya
k 2 Rm is an arbitrary vector injected by the attacker
at time k. Assume the adversary has knowledge of the system
model described in Section II-A, and the ability to inject
data over communication network between sensors and the
estimator/detector/controller.
C. The difference between normal and compromised systems
To illustrate how the sensor injection sequence yka will
affect the estimation and monitoring system, we examine
how the estimation error and residue will change with yka.
Let x^0k be the state estimation of the compromised system,
zk0 = yk0+1 C(Ax^0k + Bu0k) be the estimation residue of
the compromised system. Then, the difference between the
normal and the compromised systems can be captured by:
The dynamics of the above difference vectors satisfy:
ek , xk
ek , e0
k
x^k; e0k , x0
k
ek; zk , zk0
x^0 ;
k
zk:
ek+1 = (A
zk+1 = CA
KCA) ek
ek + yka;
a
Kyk+1;
(3)
(4)
Hence the difference vectors between normal and compromised
systems - zk(ya); ek(ya) - are functions of the
attack sequence ya , (y0a; y1a; : : : ). To simplify notations,
we concisely denote these vectors as zk; ek.
The objectives of the attacker include maximizing the
estimation error e0k without triggering the alarm, while
increasing x0k to infinity. When the system is secured,
limk!1 E[ek] ! 0, and zk is in a small range. Thus the
attacker's objective is equivalent to increasing k ekk2 (the
difference between estimation error of the normal and compromised
systems) without increasing k zkk2 much. The

vector yka to sensor outputs.
probability that yka is detected is P r(gk0 = (zk0)0T P 1zk0 >
). Since computing gk0 is integrating Gaussian on an ellipsoid,
the stealthy requirement can be approximated by
keeping kzk0k2 small. Residues of the normal system zk is
bounded, and the attacker should keep the change of residues
bounded make the injection stealthy. It means the following
inequality should hold
k zkk2
M;
(5)
where M is a residue norm change threshold designed by
the attacker. The compromised estimation residue should be
close to that of the normal system, to fool the monitoring
system. 1 When yka can be an arbitrary vector, a necessary and
sufficient condition for a stealth yka that can increase ke0kk2,
kx0kk2 to infinity while keep kzk0k2, k zkk2 bounded is derived
in [12], [11]. One of the conditions that Cv 2 span(I),
i.e., there exists y satisfying y = Cv is always satisfied by
the attack model (2). Hence, we have the following corollary.
Corollary 1: There exists a stealth sequence yka; k =
0; 1; : : : ; given the attacked system model (2), if and only
if matrix A has an unstable eigenvalue and the corresponding
eigenvector v, such that v 2 span(Qoa), where
Qoa is the controllability matrix associated with the pair
(A KCA; K).
III. CODING SENSOR OUTPUTS FOR DETECTING
STEALTH SENSOR DATA INJECTION
Existing active monitor schemes (design some additive
control input ud) and fault detection filters have limitations,
k
that even with secured actuators, they can not detect stealthy
data injection attacks. It is necessary to design some inexpensive
techniques to compensate for the vulnerability of the
system under intelligent sensor data injection attacks.
A. Limitations of existing approaches
The limitation of active monitor approach: Under the
assumption that actuators work appropriately for the attacked
system (2), the challenge here is whether adding udk to
the pre-designed linear control input uk (like optimal LQG
control) can detect stealthy sensor data injections. It is
worth noting that active monitor approaches does not help
given sensor data injection attacks satisfying Theorem 1. For
model (2), the control input does not affect the estimation
residue change quantity zk+1 according to (4), which
means there exists no u~k = uk + udk; u~0k = u0k + udk that can
increase k zk+1k2 under yka. This is because any additional
control input will be eliminated by the deduction of zk+1 and
zk0+1 to get zk+1. The limitations of active monitors for a
unified LTI model are proved in Theorem 4.7 of [7]. 2 In this
perspective, different linear controllers are equivalent under
stealth sensor data injection attacks, and we do not restrict
the controller model for designing our detection techniques.
1The relation between the scale or norm of the injection sequence and
the alarm trigger threshold is shown in Theorem 1 in [12].
2A different case when adding exogenous Gaussian distribution control
input can detect replay attacks is discussed in [14].
The limitation of fault detection filter: Besides Kalman
filter, observer-based fault detection filters for LTI systems
with unknown error have been developed. The design requirements
usually include robustness to unknown inputs
and sensitivity to faults. Such filters generate a different
residue from zk of Kalman filter. Consider the following
form of residual generator and residual evaluator (including a
threshold and a decision logic unit, see [15] for details) [15]:
x^k+1 = Ax^k + Buk + H(yk
y^k);
y^k = Cx^k; rk = V (yk
y^k);
(6)
where x^k 2 Rn and y^k 2 Rp represent the state and
output estimation vectors, respectively, and rk is the residual
signal. This fault detector shares the same limitation with
Kalman filter, i.e., the intelligent sensor data injection attack
is stealth for the filter described as (6), since the residue is
still observer based difference between yk and y^k.
B. Coding sensor outputs to detect stealth data injection
Since existing monitoring system can not detect intelligent
false data injection attacks, and encryption method has a
constraint of significant computation overhead, we propose
a design of coding the sensor outputs to detect stealth
sensor data injection attacks. An intelligent attacker designs
the sequence yka carefully to keep the change of residue
k zkk2 M , where M is a constant. Thus the objective of
a detection approach is equivalent to increasing k zkk2 to
infinity as time goes to infinity.
The necessary and sufficient conditions for stealth false
sensor data injection in Corollary 1 assume that the attacker
knows (A; B; C; K). Parameters A and B are related to
physical dynamics that may not be altered, while C is
related to the sensor measurements, corresponding specific
physical states. Without changing the physical setup, we still
can manipulate the sensor outputs. To violate the attacker's
design, we consider the method of transforming sensor
outputs as shown in Figure 2-instead of sending the output
vector yk = Cxk + vk to the estimator/controller/detector,
sensors are transmitting the value:
Yk =
(Cxk + vk); C 2 Rp n;
(7)
where 2 Rp p is an invertible matrix. One can think of
as an inexpensive code. We assume that the attacker does not
know the matrix , and designed a sequence of stealth attack
signal yka with parameters (A; B; C; K). One can compare
with a secured key. By encrypting only the coding matrix
channel once, the coding approach saves encryption cost

that satisfies the conditions of Theorem 1. Assume the attacker can inject
arbitrary false data vector yka to sensor outputs.

compared with encrypting all sensor outputs. In this case,
the false sensor value after transforming changes to:
Yk0 =
Cxk + yka +
vk:
(8)
Assume the corresponding Kalman filter with sensor output
Yk has a steady state estimation error covariance matrix P 0
and a Kalman gain matrix K0 that satisfy
K0 = P 0CT T ( CP 0CT T +
R) 1:
Similarly as (4), define e0k; zk0 as the change of state
estimation and residue for the sensor output (7), (8). With
, a stealth data injection designed for (1) (with parameters
(A; B; C; K)), k zk0k2 increases to infinity as k ! 1 under
certain conditions. In the following theorem, we show the
sufficient conditions that should satisfy for any stealth
sequence of yka; k = 0; 1; : : : that satisfies Theorem 1.
Theorem 1: Given an attacked system model (2), assume
that the attacker designs a sequence of sensor data injection
yka; k = 0; 1; : : : , based on one unstable eigenvector v of A
that satisfies Corollary 1. If there exists an invertible matrix
such that (A; C) is detectable, and the direction of Cv
is not the same with that of Cv, i.e.,
(Cv)0 Cv
k Cvk2kCvk2
6= 1;
then after injecting yka the estimation residue change k zk0k2
is increased , by coding sensor outputs (7) with .
Proof: See Appendix.
We call a matrix that satisfies the conditions of Theorem 1
a feasible coding matrix. Theorem 1 proves that even the
attacker knows system parameters (A; B; C; K), without
changing the physical structure or altering A; B, we can
utilize the sensor data to get different residues for detecting.
Leveraging sensor outputs is the key reason to detect a
stealth sensor data injection. It is worth noting that here we
do not constrain specific structure of the matrix besides
conditions in Theorem 1. For an LTI system, C is simply
a linear transform of the original sensor measurement. When
A has several unstable eigenvectors satisfying Corollary 1,
the following lemma extends the result of Theorem 1.
Lemma 1: Given an attacked system (2) with a set of
unstable eigenvectors v1; : : : ; vu satisfying Corollary 1, if
is an invertible matrix such that (A; C) is detectable, and
(Cv~)0 Cv~
k Cv~k2kCv~k2
6= 1;
for any linear combination of v1; : : : ; vu - v~, then is a
feasible coding matrix to increase k zk0k2 for any stealth
data injection to attacked system (2).
Remark 1: When the attacker is able to learn by analyzing
sensor outputs and actuator inputs, the system can send
a new before the attacker figures out the current applied
coding matrix. This will be an avenue for future work.
IV. ALGORITHM TO COMPUTE A CODING MATRIX
To compute a set of feasible coding matrices, we first
analyze requirements of an optimal coding matrix, and then
(9)
(10)
decouple the requirements to an approximate optimization
problem and a corresponding system parameter design problem.
The constraints are relaxed step by step to achieve
an iterative algorithm, such that each iteration step of the
algorithm is a convex optimization problem.
The transformed observer data should maximize the difference
between estimation residue of the normal and attacked
system - k zk0k2, which is equivalent to maximizing
k Cv Cvk2 (or v~), by the proof of Theorem 1. We do
not want to sacrifice the state estimation performance of the
coded the system, and e0k should not increase fast compared
with ek, thus we require that (A; C) is detectable for a
steady state Kalman filter. With transformed sensor values
Yk in (7), we compute a new gain matrix K0 for the steady
state Kalman filter, such that A~ = A K0 CA is stable.
Hence the estimation error of the normal system with sensor
output Yk = Cxk + vk satisfies
lim E[e~k+1] = (A K0 CA)E[e~k] ! 0: (11)
k!1
The norm of should be bounded, because computable
values of the estimator, controller, and detector are bounded.
These requirements and objective are described as
maximize k Cv
subject to k k2 ;
(A; C) detectable;
Cvk2
invertible;
(A
K0 CA) stable:
(12)
The above problem (12) is not convex, since maximizing a
norm is a concave function of . There is no closed form
equation between K0 and for the constraint related to K0.
To decouple the design process, we ignore the constraint
related to K0 and detectability of (A; C), compute an
optimal satisfying other constraints first, and check the
ignored constraints later.
Given the system parameter matrices C, A, ignoring the
requirement about K0, the objective of (12) is approximately
to find an invertible, bounded that maximizes k Cv
Cvk2. In general, when is unbounded, k Cv Cvk2 !
1. Considering the direction change of vector Cv after
transformed by Cv, the optimal direction to maximize the
difference between Cv and Cv is the orthogonal direction.
Thus, we have the following Lemma 2.
Lemma 2: Assume the attacker designs a sequence of
injections that satisfies Corollary 1, based on an unstable
eigenvector v. If there exists a feasible solution of that
satisfies the following constraints (13),
(Cv)0 Cv = 0; k k2
;
is invertible;
(13)
and (A; C) is detectable, then we have an optimal direction
coding matrix that satisfies Theorem 1.
Remark 2: When should work for any linear combination
of multiple unstable eigenvectors v~, we start from an
invertible orthogonal rotation matrix that rotates any vector
through 2 angle. Then check other constraints, if they are
violated, we will find a heuristic algorithm. This will be an
avenue for future work.
5779
For system with only one unstable eigenvector that satisfies
Corollary 1, solving (13) directly may not return a feasible
satisfying Theorem 1. The following convex optimization
formulation presents a relaxed problem as one iteration.
When = 0, is not invertible, though (Cv)0 Cv = 0.
So we use a conservative constraint 0 to replace the
invertible constraint. Log determinant function of 0
will drive away from an all zero elements matrix, and the
objective function is concave. There always exists a solution
for (13) (an orthogonal rotation matrix), however, when
we restrict the solution space to be positive-semidefinite
(SDP), and (A; C) to be detectable, (Cv)0 Cv = 0 is
a strict constraint. When this is the case, we relax (13) to an
inequality constraint with a small , and get the formulation:
maximize
subject to
log det
k k2
j(Cv)0 Cvj
;
kCvk22;
0:
(14)
Thus, we have the following iteration algorithm. Algorithm 1
starts from the constraint that (Cv)0 Cv = 0, i.e., the
orthogonal transform. During each iteration, the algorithm
relaxes the constraint, increases , till there is a feasible
satisfying (A; C) is detectable. With such a and
a corresponding K0, (11) is guaranteed. The change of
estimation error of the coded system under a data injection
attack- e0k should not increase too fast compared with
ek. It means we do not need to sacrifice the estimation
performance to detect stealth data injection attacks. This
result is also shown in Section V.
Algorithm 1 : Compute a feasible coding matrix
Input: System model parameters A; B; C; K , an unstable
eigenvalue and eigenvector ; v of A, and a stealth sensor
data injection sequence yka.
Initialization: Set the total iteration step number T , = 0,
and -the increase step size of .
Iteration: For t = 1; 2 : : : ; T , compute problem (14):
If there is no feasible , let = + , t = t + 1.
If there exists a , check the detectability of (A; C):
if (A; C) is not detectable, let = + , t = t + 1;
else if (A; C) is detectable, compute a steady state Kalman
filter gain matrix K0 corresponding to the new sensor outputs
Yk = Cxk + vk, and stop the iteration, return the result.
Return: A feasible transform matrix and a corresponding
steady state kalman filter gain matrix K0.
Algorithm 1 is terminated once a feasible is computed.In
the worst case, when ! , solution = I satisfies all
the constraints, and (A; I C) is detectable, Algorithm 1 will
terminate. It is worth noting that Theorem 1 is a sufficient
condition. Even the direction of Cv is the same with that
of Cv, with Cv 6= Cv we still increase k zk02. The norm
increasing speed is relatively slow though. This is explained
in the proof of Theorem 1.

of a coded system does not necessarily increase faster than
the original system.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this work, we have proposed a method of coding
sensor outputs to detect stealth sensor data injection attacks,
designed by an intelligent attacker with system model
knowledge. Without changing physical setup, we transform
the sensor outputs and provide conditions when a linear
combination of original sensor outputs can help to detect
a stealthy injection sequence. An iterative optimization algorithm
is developed to compute a feasible transform matrix
efficiently, and examples show detection effects after coding
sensor values. In the future, we will explore scenarios where
the attacker is capable to learn the coding matrix.
APPENDIX
Proof of Theorem 1
Proof: Given a system under data injection attacks
as (2), we assume that the system has one unstable eigenvector
v with corresponding eigenvalue . According to the
definition in equation (3), the dynamics of ek; zk satisfy
Similarly, for coded sensor outputs (8),
ek+1 = (A

Based on the proof of Theorem 1 in [12], the only component
of ek that goes to infinity eventually is
ckv; lim ck = 1;
k!1
and
ek can be decomposed as
ek = ckv + 1k; k 1kk2
M1:
To keep zk bounded as k ! 1, any stealth injection
sequence yka must satisfy
yka =
ck Cv + 2k; k 2kk2
M2; k = 0; 1; 2; : : : ; (19)
where M2 is a constant such that k zkk2 M for all k.
We assume that the attacker does not know , and designs
a injection sequence for the original system (1) as described
in (19). Similarly as ek, the only component of e0k that
can goes to infinity is ck , since matrix A is not changed
by the coding matrix . However, with any yka in (19), zk0
can be decomposed as
zk0 = ck ( Cv

where 3k is a bounded vector components of zk0. When

and eigenvalues 1; : : : ; u, the above proof still holds after
replacing ckv with Pu i=1 cik iCvi.
i=1 cikvi, ck Cv with Pu
When (A; C) is detectable, there exists a steady state
Kalman filter with parameter K0 for the coded system, and
the corresponding fault detector. Hence, when the attacker
designs a stealth injection sequence without knowledge of
, the system can detect it by increasing k zk0k2 with .
