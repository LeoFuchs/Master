Quickest Detection of False Data Injection Attack
in Wide-Area Smart Grids
Shang Li, Yasin Yılmaz, and Xiaodong Wang, Fellow, IEEE
Abstract-We consider the sequential (i.e., online) detection of
false data injection attacks in smart grid, which aims to manipulate
the state estimation procedure by injecting malicious data
to the monitoring meters. The unknown parameters in the system,
namely the state vector, injected malicious data and the
set of attacked meters pose a significant challenge for designing
a robust, computationally efficient, and high-performance
detector. We propose a sequential detector based on the generalized
likelihood ratio to address this challenge. Specifically,
the proposed detector is designed to be robust to a variety of
attacking strategies, and load situations in the power system,
and its computational complexity linearly scales with the number
of meters. Moreover, it considerably outperforms the existing
first-order cumulative sum detector in terms of the average detection
delay and robustness to various attacking strategies. For
wide-area monitoring in smart grid, we further develop a distributed
sequential detector using an adaptive sampling technique
called level-triggered sampling. The resulting distributed detector
features single bit per sample in terms of the communication
overhead, while preserving the high performance of the proposed
centralized detector.

I. INTRODUCTION
U tightly integrated with the cyber-infrastructure, such as
NDER THE smart grid concept, the power system is
computer and communication networks, which makes it vulnerable
to cyber-attacks. Cyber-security is a critical issue in
smart grid since cyber-attacks may eventually cause catastrophic
consequences such as blackouts in large geographic
areas. Furthermore, it is far more difficult to detect malicious
data attacks than to detect random errors in the power systems
because the adversary can choose the site of attack judiciously
and design attack data carefully. Consequently, cyber-security
for smart grid has drawn significant interest in [1]-[4].

State estimation is a fundamental task for power
grid [5]-[7]. Meter measurements are used to estimate state
variables such as bus voltages and phase angles. Then, various
power grid components are controlled based on the state
estimates. Cyber-attacks in the power system monitoring, is
defined as the attacks that aim to cause erroneous state estimates
by manipulating meter measurements. Thus, they are
also known as false data injection attacks. In the conventional
centralized setup, meter readings are transmitted to
a control center, and stored in a supervisory control and
data acquisition (SCADA) system. Due to the deregulation
of modern power grids, wide-area monitoring recently draws
extensive attention. In wide-area monitoring, there is a number
of sub-areas, each of which only has access to its own
meter measurements, and communicates with others and the
control center through the wireless medium. The centralized
setup may not be practically feasible in wide-area monitoring
because of the power and bandwidth constraints of the
wireless communication systems. Thus, distributed detection
is of interest, in which a primary objective is to minimize the
communication overhead.
The naive approach to distributed detection samples the
meter readings uniformly in time, and then synchronously
transmits samples from sub-areas to the control center.
Fortunately, for detecting the false data injection attacks, since
only the post-attack measurements bear information, we can
considerably decrease the communication overhead, compared
to the naive approach, by transmitting only the informative
measurements from sub-areas to the control center. The random
nature of the attacking time constitutes the challenge here. An
adaptive sampling technique called level-triggered sampling,
that decides whether to transmit or not each time a new measurement
is taken, can effectively handle this challenge. In [8]
and [9], it was shown that level-triggered sampling enables
efficient information transmission under stringent communication
and energy constraints. Specifically, as opposed to the
naive uniform-in-time sampling, it allows the sampling times
to be determined by the signal to be sampled, hence censors
uninformative measurements and enables the changes in the
signal level to be easily tracked at a remote place using a few
bits of message passing. Hence, it is well suited to distributed
cyber-attack detection in wide-area smart grids.
Most of the existing works on distributed detection consider
fixed-sample-size (also known as one-shot) schemes, which
aim to reach a satisfactory balance between the detection probability
and false alarm probability. This type of schemes is
useful when there is no strict latency constraint. On the other

hand, strict latency constraints apply to cyber-attack detection
since such attacks are judiciously designed, and if not timely
detected, can cause catastrophic consequences. The sequential
detection framework, and in particular, sequential change
detection (also known as quickest detection), which minimizes
the average detection delay subject to certain performance constraint,
enables online (i.e., real-time) monitoring for smart
grid, hence suits well to cyber-attack detection.
Sequential detection (or quickest detection) of false data
injection attacks is yet to be more carefully designed. The
well-known Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) algorithm is minimax
optimum under the centralized setup if the probability distributions
before and after the attack are known [10]. However,
typically there are several unknowns in cyber-attack detection
for smart grid, namely the state vector, the injected malicious
data, and the subset of meters compromised by the attackers.
In [11], an adaptive CUSUM algorithm is proposed, which
assumes a Gaussian prior with some fixed mean and covariance
for the state vector, and also assumes that the injected
data is small and positive in magnitude so that the firstorder
approximation to the decision statistic can be used. That
scheme, as a result, becomes inefficient for large attacking
data, which could be more detrimental to the network, and
also for negative data, as shown in Section V.
In this paper, we propose new CUSUM-type algorithms
based on the generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) for centralized
and distributed cyber-attack detection. With the proposed
algorithms, we establish, under the centralized and distributed
setups, an online (i.e., real-time) monitoring framework, that
is robust to arbitrary load situations in the power system
and malicious data, and also computationally efficient. Our
contributions are listed as follows.
1) The proposed algorithms are robust to arbitrary state
variables (due to different load situations in the power
system), arbitrary malicious data injected to the meter
readings.
2) The computational complexity of the proposed algorithms
scales linearly with the number of meters in the
system.
3) The proposed algorithms significantly outperform the
existing methods in the literature in terms of the average
detection delay, as shown in Section V.
4) The proposed distributed detector leads to a very low
communication overhead and energy consumption by
censoring the uninformative measurements before the
attack and transmitting a single bit per sample to the
control center, thanks to the adaptive level-triggered
sampling technique.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In
Section II, we briefly introduce the power grid monitoring
system model and the associated false data injection
attack detection problem. Then, we propose the centralized
attack detector in Section III. Section IV treats the distributed
attack detection in wide-area power grid by drawing
on the novel level-triggered sampling scheme. In Section V,
we provide extensive numerical experiments to demonstrate
the advantages of the proposed detectors over the existing
methods. Finally, Section VI concludes this paper.

II. BACKGROUND AND PROBLEM STATEMENT
Consider M meters in an (N + 1)-bus power system. In
this paper, we use the direct current (dc) power flow model,
in which the N phase angles (one reference angle), denoted
by the state vector x [θ1, . . . , θN ] , are to be estimated.
Suppose, we collect all measurements of the power flows and
power injections at time t in the vector yt, then we have the
following linear system model [2], [27]:
yt = Hxt + et
(1)
where yt consists of the meter readings at time t, H ∈ RM×N is
the measurement matrix, and et ∼ N (0, σ 2IM) is the measurement
noise vector. Typically, the number of measurements is
greater than that of the unknown parameters in order to provide
necessary redundancy against the noise effect, i.e., M > N.
In addition, aiming at a general application, we consider the
dynamic state model, where the state vector evolves over time.
A. Problem Statement
Suppose the malicious attack strikes at time τ and intentionally
manipulates the meter readings by ut. Accordingly,
we write the attack-incurred measurement change as
yt = Hxt + et, t < τ
yt = Hxt + ut + et = H (xt + ct) + bt + et, t ≥ τ.
(2)
Note that here the aggregate injected false data (i.e., ut)
has been decomposed into two parts Hct and bt, where Hct
represents the component that lies in the column space of H
[i.e., Hct ∈ R(H)], while bt lies in the corresponding complementary
space [i.e., bt ∈ R⊥(H) and H(H H)−1H bt = 0].
As pointed out by [12], bt is the only informative part that
is detectable while Hct would seemingly bypass the monitoring
system since it is indistinguishable from Hxt per se.
Hence, attackers intend to make the best use of their knowledge
and resources to prevent detection, i.e., they try to hide
attack vectors in the column space of H. If attackers perfectly
knew the network information (that is the value of matrix
H, including the topology and the line parameters, i.e., line
admittances and transformer tap ratio), and could manipulate
any meter they want, then they would be able to design
stealth attacks that completely lie in R(H), i.e., bt = 0, hence
bypass the security system [12]. Fortunately, in practice, this
is not the case in a wide-area smart grid due to the following
factors. First, most attackers gain network information by longterm
off-line learning, whereas the power grid configuration
could change over time (for example, the environment fluctuation
can alter the line admittances); thus the attackers are
unlikely to possess the real-time network information. Second,
the attackers may have limited resources to access/manipulate
sufficient set of smart meters. Notably, Liu and Li [13] put
forth a local load redistribution [14] that constructs perfect
attack with regional network information, efficiently lowering
the information requirement. Nevertheless, such an attack
could be prevented by securing sufficient meters according
to [3], where the fundamental limit of perfect attack was investigated.
Therefore, assuming that there is always a trace of the
LI et al.: QUICKEST DETECTION OF FALSE DATA INJECTION ATTACK IN WIDE-AREA SMART GRIDS
2727
attack vector (i.e., some components of bt are nonzeros), we
further write the change event of interest as
btm = 0, m = 1, 2, . . . , M, t < τ
|btm| > γ , m ∈ , t ≥ τ
(3)
where γ is a prescribed value, setting the lower bound for the
measurement change that draws security attentions and the
set contains the significant components in the informative
vector bt, referred to as attacked meters thereafter.
As such, our goal here is to detect the attack vector bt as
soon as possible after its occurrence at τ . The quickest detection,
that exploits the statistical difference before and after the
change-point, provides a suitable framework to achieve this
goal.
B. Quickest Detection
In quickest detection, we sequentially observe samples in
time, and then stop according to a predesigned rule to declare
a change. Unlike the fixed-sample-size schemes that focus on
the detection power, the sequential change detector aims at
minimizing the average detection delay after the change-point.
The commonly used performance measure is the worst-case
average detection delay, proposed by Lorden [15]
J(T) = sup ess supFτ Eτ (T − τ )+|Fτ .
τ
(4)
Here, T is a stopping time variable, corresponding to a
certain detection scheme; Fτ is the filtration, which can be
understood as all the observations up to τ , y1, . . . , yτ . Thus,
the expectation Eτ is evaluated with respect to the post-change
probability measure conditioned on the change-point τ and
the past samples up to τ . The essential supremum is obtained
over Fτ , yielding the least favorable situation for the detection
delay.1 The supremum in (4) is obtained over τ , meaning
that the change occurs at such a point that the detection delay
is maximized. To summarize, J(T) characterizes the average
detection delay for the worst possible history of observations
before the change-point. While the small average detection
delay under attack results in timely alarmed reaction, the running
length under normal data, on the other hand, needs to be
controlled to avoid frequent false alarms. Hence, the sequential
change detection problem is formulated as follows:
inf J(T) subject to
T
E∞[T] ≥ α.
(5)
Note that E∞ corresponds to the case where the change
never happens, i.e., τ = ∞. To proceed with our cyber-attack
detection problem, we denote the pre and postattack probability
density functions (PDF) of the meter readings as p0 and p1,
respectively. If all parameters in the PDFs can be specified,
the quickest detection problem in (5) is optimally solved by
the well-known CUSUM test [10]

⎭
1Simply put, ess supFτ can be understood as the least upper bound of the
objective function for all possible values of y1, y2, . . . , yτ .
Note that, to fully specify the test statistic in (6), the values
of xt, ct, and bt must be known. However, in reality, acquiring
such information is hardly practical, rendering the CUSUM
test infeasible. For example, xt is unknown and needs to be
estimated, as it is the essential task of the power grid monitoring
system. In light of this, as we mentioned before, ct will
be completely mistaken as a part of the state vector in this
estimation procedure and becomes indistinguishable from xt.
In addition, considering the diverse nature of the attacking
behaviors, bt cannot be specified beforehand when designing
the security system. Alternatively, in [11], the first-order
approximation is proposed by assuming that bt is elementwise
positive and small. It deviates from the optimal solution
as bt becomes significant, which, in fact, is the regime of most
interest. To address these issues, this paper resorts to the GLR
method, that provides asymptotically optimal performance by
replacing the unknown parameters with their maximum likelihood
estimates (MLE) [16, Sec. 5.3]. We next propose novel
centralized and distributed sequential attack detectors based
on the GLR statistic.
III. CENTRALIZED SEQUENTIAL ATTACK DETECTION
In this section, we consider the cyber-attack detection problem
in a centralized setup. That is, all meter readings across
the network are collected at a control center and processed
together. We first derive a GLR-based change detector, namely
generalized CUSUM, which is asymptotically optimal in theory,
but its computational complexity is exponential in the
number of meters, making it infeasible in large-scale networks.
Then, we propose a modified detector whose computational
complexity is linear in the number of meters.
A. Generalized CUSUM Detector
Based on the change event modeled by (3), upon replacing
the unknown parameters with their MLEs in (6), the generalized
CUSUM takes the form given by (7) (shown at the top
of next page). Note that ct is indistinguishable from xt, thus
we combine them together as xt under p1. Compared to the
method in [11], this sequential detector possesses the following
advantages.
1) The state vector xt, which holds the bus phase angles, is
not assumed to be a stationary Gaussian process, which
is unrealistic for modeling a time-varying workload.
Instead, xt is estimated over time, providing robustness
to arbitrary load situations in the power system.
2) The attacking vector bt is neither assumed to be small,
nor presumed in the first orthant (i.e., element-wise
positive). Like xt, estimating bt results in robustness
to significant magnitude and direction changes in the
attacking vector.
3) The uncertainty in the subset of attacked meters is
incorporated into the detector.
We first compute the GLR st at time t conditioned on the
set . Given that et is white Gaussian noise, supxt yields the
least-squares estimators under the two probability measures,
that is

In the centralized setup, all measurements are collected at
the control center, thus yt Pyt, which is the projection
of the measurement vector on R⊥(H), is readily obtained.

with Tn min{k : max1≤ j≤k tk=j m∈ n stm ≥ h}, where n
represents a specific subset of all meters. Note that the equality
between (13) and (14) holds true thanks to the discrete value
of (see [17] and a special case where the sup is evaluated
over binary values has been discussed as two-sided CUSUM
in [16, Sec. 2.2]). Consequently, following [17], (14) suggests
that Tg can be implemented as a multichart scheme, where one
GLR-based test is performed for each n, and the detection
procedure stops as soon as one of these tests raises an alarm.

(14)
This multichart scheme has a computational complexity that
is linear in the number of meters, i.e., O(M), only when we
know that there is only a single attacked meter, i.e., q = 1. In
this specific case, Tg amounts to the single-bit change detector
proposed in [18], i.e., each meter runs its local GLR-based test
and the global detection procedure stops whenever a meter
raises an alarm. However, in general, when the number of
attacked meters is unknown, then (14) has a computational
complexity exponential in the number of meters, i.e., O(2M).
B. Proposed Detector With Linear Complexity
We next propose an efficient detector that is linearly scalable
to the number of attacked meters, and robust to the changes
in the attacking vector. Note that the operator max1≤ j≤k
in Tg implies that all the attacked meters are stricken at
the same time, i.e., they share the same estimated changepoint
j = arg max1≤ j≤k tk=j m∈ stm. It is this underlying
assumption that leads to Tm's that have to be run for all combinations,
hindering us from further simplifying the detection
procedure. To that end, we relax the constraint on simultaneous
attack and modify the decision statistic of Tg in (13) by
allowing each meter to search its own change-point, that is

Through the above derivation, the relaxation (i.e., individual
search for change-point at each meter) on the GLR statistic
of Tg has transformed the combinatorial search sup into the
operation of sum. This modification turns out to significantly
simplify the original general CUSUM test Tg, given that the
number of meters in the modern power system is in the order
of hundreds or thousands. In addition, in the case where the
attack strikes each meter asynchronously (e.g., there are time
skews), searching the change-point at each meter is expected
to be more effective. Consequently, following (13) and (16),
we arrive at the resulting change detector:

(20)
Combining (17) and (19) implies that the global decision
statistic is obtained by summing up the local CUSUM-type
recursive processes. As a matter of fact, using the sum of
multiple CUSUM processes as the test statistic was studied
in [19]. By the virtue of the analysis therein, we know that
the detection delay of the proposed detector Tp shares the similar
asymptotic optimality with Tg. In particular, they deviate
from the optimal (which is only feasible when all parameters
are known) by O(log log α) and O(constant), respectively,
recalling that α is the false alarm period as defined in (5).
Therefore, for practical scenarios where α = 102 ∼ 106, Tp
performs as effectively as Tg, yet at a much lower implementation
complexity. In a nutshell, the proposed detector in (17)
features the following merits.
1) Its computational complexity scales linearly with the
network size, i.e., O(M), even when there is no prior
knowledge about the set of attacked meters, as opposed
to generalized CUSUM, which is O(2M).
2) It is robust, like the generalized CUSUM, to the changes
in the distribution of the state vector xt, the magnitude,
and direction changes in the attacking vector bt, and the
uncertainty in the set of attacked meters.
3) It also greatly facilitates the decentralization of cyberattack
monitoring in wide-area power grids, which will
be discussed in next section.
We summarize the proposed sequential attack detector
[see (17)] in Algorithm 1. Before performing this algorithm,
the parameters γ and h need to be prescribed. To be specific,
the lower bound γ is decided according to the designer's tolerance
on the attacking impact. A larger γ emphasizes interest
in the malicious data with a higher impact, whereas a smaller
γ implies sensitivity to small distortions. The decision threshold
h is tailored to meet a certain performance requirement,
i.e., the average detection delay J(Tp) or the false alarm period
α (owing to the diversity of attacks, the worst-scenario detection
delay could be considered). Correspondingly, an off-line
simulation suffices to fix the value of h, which only needs to
be updated when the system setting is altered, for example,
the noise level changes.

IV. WIDE-AREA CYBER-ATTACK DETECTION
In the previous section, the proposed sequential detector is
developed under the centralized setup, where all the raw meter
readings in the network are collected synchronously at each
time by the control center. This induces a significant communication
overhead in wide-area networks. As a matter of fact,
communication across wide areas has become a critical concern
in modern power grids, where wireless communication
infrastructure (e.g., WiMax, Cellular, WiFi, Zigbee, Bluetooth)
plays an important role [20]-[23]. In particular, [22] demonstrated
the use of code division multiple access technology for
power system SCADA, by providing cellular communication
between sub-area remote terminal unit and SCADA server.
Similarly, general packet radio service technology can also
be applied to sub-area-to-SCADA communication [24]. On
the other hand, the power industry deregulation has divided
the large interconnected power system into increasingly many
sub-areas [4], [5], [25]. In many cases, sub-areas are geographically
separated, spanning over a vast area, which renders the
communications and coordinations in the network challenging.
All these have called for a more distributed setup in which
sub-areas collect and manage their local meter readings, and
then communicate with the control center for collaborative
wide-area monitoring. In light of this practice, we proceed
to propose a novel distributed sequential detector based on
the proposed centralized detector Tp and a nonuniform sampling
technique called level-triggered sampling. The resulting
distributed detector remarkably decreases the communication
overhead, yet preserves the high detection performance.
A. System Model and Background
Suppose there are L sub-areas and M meters in an
(N + 1)-bus network. As such, the meter readings yt are
divided into L sub-vectors, i.e., yt = [yt(1) , yt(2) , . . . , yt(L) ] ,
where yt( ) represents the measurements in sub-area .
Similarly, sub-areas confront the attack vector bt =
[bt(1) , bt(2) , . . . , bt(L) ] and compute the projection yt =
[yt(1) , yt(2) , . . . , yt(L) ] . The first issue that arises in the distributed
setup is computing the projection yt = Pyt = yt−Hxˆt0,
which is readily available at the control center in the centralized
setup. However, in the distributed setup, yt needs to be
computed in a distributed fashion. Note that, in general, subareas
are interconnected, and thus H is not perfectly block
diagonal [though usually nearly so, e.g., the measurement
matrix of the IEEE-14 bus system given by (32)], meaning
that (1) cannot be directly decoupled into L sub-systems.
2730
IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID, VOL. 6, NO. 6, NOVEMBER 2015
Consequently, the projection matrix P = I − H(H H)−1H is
not block diagonal, preventing a simple expression for yt( ).
To resolve this issue, we first write the measurement model
for each sub-area
yt( ) = H xt( ) + bt( ) + et( ),
= 1, . . . , L
(21)
where bt( ) = 0 before attack, x( ) ∈ RN , N is the number
of local buses and H ∈ RM ×N , M is the number of
local meter readings. Note that here the neighboring sub-areas
may share some state parameters, i.e., xt( ) and xt(i), i ∈ N ,
where N denotes the set of neighboring sub-areas to ,
overlap partially owing to the meters deployed at their crosslinks
(usually termed as tie-line). In the global estimator
vector xˆt0 = (H H)−1H yt, denote the estimates of the state
parameters associated to sub-area with xˆt( ). Then, we can
write
yt( ) = yt( ) − H xˆt( ).
(22)
Hence, each sub-area needs to compute the local estimator
vector xˆt( ), which is a function of all measurements related to
xt( ) in the network. In other words, due to interconnectedness,
x( ) is not only a function of the measurements taken at subˆt
area . Performing several iterations of data fusion between
neighboring sub-areas, we can compute xˆt( ) at sub-area via
the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). The
more iterations we have in ADMM, the closer it is to the
global solution. Distributed state estimation using ADMM is
well studied in [7] and we briefly summarize the procedure
here. At each time t (we neglect the index t for notational convenience
in (23)-(25), and the subscript i is used for the index
of iteration, i.e., xˆi( ) is the state estimate of x( ) at time t after
ith iteration of ADMM), the following recursive computation
of xˆt( ) is performed.

where a[ j] denotes the jth entry of vector a, and j is the
index for the state parameter in sub-area that are shared
with others and ω j is the set of the sub-areas sharing
the variable xˆ( )[ j] with sub-area . Depending on the
overlapping level of the network, j can take multiple
values for each sub-area. In a word, fi [ j] is the average
of the counterparts of xˆ( )[ j] from the neighbors that
share it.

the local state estimate

with pi defined in the following recursive way:

Where D ∈ NN ×N is a diagonal matrix defined for each
sub-area with the (j, j)th entry equal to |ωj | (i.e., the number
of elements in set w j), and c is a small constant which
where gk Wkm denotes the local statistic of sub-area
at time k, anmd∈WNkm is given by (12) and (18). Nonetheless,
transmitting multibit quantized sub-area statistics to the control
center at every sampling instant still imposes demanding communication
requirements. Next, we propose a level-triggered
sampling scheme in which sub-areas sporadically transmit
single-bit information to the control center to report the
changes in their local statistics, thus significantly decreasing
the communication overhead.
B. Distributed Sequential Attack Detector
In the conventional approach, each sub-area samples its
local statistic gk uniformly over time, and transmits quantization
bits to the control center for each sample. Alternatively,
level-triggered sampling, adapting the sampling (and thus
communication) times to gk, requires significantly less number
of bits for accurate representation of each sample. Moreover,
adaptive sampling (communication) suits very well to the
nonuniform nature of gk, which hovers around zero before
the attack and steadily increases after the attack.
Specifically, in level-triggered sampling, a sample is taken
when the change in the signal with respect to its most recent
approximation exceeds a certain level, say . Define kn as the
nth sampling time at sub-area , and gk as the approximation
n
to gk due to the accumulation of single-bit change information
n
at sampling times until kn. Given g , the next sampling is
kn−1
triggered at time
kn
inf k > kn−1 : gk − gkn−1 ∈/ (%
, ) .
The single-bit change information
φn
sign g
kn − gkn−1
is then transmitted to the control center at time kn. Here, is a
positive constant, selected to control the frequency of transmission
(i.e., the transmission frequency decreases with increasing
) and is known to the control center. The control center can
recursively compute the approximation
g
kn = gkn−1 + φn .
can be adjusted for convergence consideration. Here, f and p
are auxilliary variables for expressing the data fusion process.
Note that the local partial data exchange between neighboring
sub-areas in ADMM is much more efficient in terms
of communication resources than the global data fusion in
the centralized setup. However, we still need to devise a
resource-efficient method to combine the local statistics {Wkm}
for sequential attack detection as in (17).
As a result, with the local projection vector yt( ) available
through ADMM, we can implement the sequential detector Tp
[see (17)] as

compared to gk ), since it is caused by the last single increment
n
that triggers sampling, and gk, being a likelihood-ratio-based
statistic, does not experience abrupt increments. Most importantly,
the discrepancy does not propagate over time since each
overshoot is compensated at the next sampling time. This is
illustrated in Fig. 1, where εi is the overshoot at each leveltriggered
sampling instant. It can be seen that ε2 at k3 is
included in the next update of the increment at k4, and
similarly, the new overshoot ε3 at k4 will be updated to the
control center in the upcoming sampling instant. We summarize
the implementation of level-triggered sampling at sub-area
as Algorithm 2.
On the other hand, to realize the detection scheme Tp
in (26), the wide-area control center receives information bits
from all sub-areas asynchronously and updates the global
running statistic as follows:
gk = gk−1 +

where {A} is the indicator function, taking the value 1 if
A is true and 0 otherwise. The distributed sequential detector
based on level-triggered sampling at the control center is
summarized in Algorithm 3. Every time the global decision
statistic is updated, the control center compares it with the
prescribed threshold h to determine whether to raise an alarm
or to continue receiving information from sub-areas.
In summary, the level-triggered sampling scheme features
an inherent data compression and adaptive communication
between the distributed sub-areas and control center, thus

V. NUMERICAL RESULTS
In this section, we examine the proposed cyber-attack detectors
numerically based on the IEEE 14-bus system (Fig. 2).
Voltage magnitudes are set to be equal and normalized to 1.
Line admittances are set to be j1. All the meters are placed in
the same way as [5], [7], and [26]. The network is partitioned
into four sub-areas, whose buses are grouped with dashed lines
in Fig. 2. As such, the measurement matrix H is given by (32),
where the columns are arranged such that the structure of
overlapped states between neighboring sub-areas is revealed
and the sub-area measurement matrices H , = 1, 2, 3, 4 are
highlighted by blue dashed boxes. Throughout this section,
γ = 0.02 and all meters readings are contaminated independently
by AWGN with variance σ 2 = 10−4. We examine the
proposed detectors both in centralized and distributed scenarios.
The dynamic state parameters are generated by running
the MATPOWER “case14” dc power-flow algorithm with
linear load increase at some randomly selected buses [27].
Bus 6 is presumed as the reference bus. First, using an
example of bt, we compare the decision statistics of the
proposed centralized detector and the “first-order CUSUM”
in [11]. Then, we apply the proposed detector and firstorder
CUSUM to a large group of randomly generated bt to
examine their robustness for unknown bt. We also illustrate
that the distributed detector based on level-triggered sampling
yields well-approximated decision statistic at the control
center. Finally, the average detection delay performance is
plotted against the false alarm period to show the effectiveness
of the distributed detector compared to its centralized
counterpart.

refer to power-flow measurements between two buses, and the squares refer
to power injection measurements.
A. Centralized Detector Versus First-Order Detector
We begin by demonstrating the decision statistics of the
proposed centralized detector and the first-order CUSUM
approach [11] before and after the attack occurs. Suppose the
attack occurs at τ = 150 (marked by blue dashed lines in the
figures). The attacking vector is generated as
bt∗ = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, −1, 1,
− 6, −5, −48, 43, −23, 47, 132, −21] × 10−4
and bt ∈ R⊥(H). Fig. 3 depicts how the decision statistics
react to the attacking behavior (the top plot is under the attack
of bt and bottom plot is under the attack of 1.5bt). As seen
from the top plot, the first-order CUSUM exhibits more fluctuation
than the proposed detector, indicating a higher false
alarm rate/smaller false alarm period E∞[T]. Both methods
show abrupt increase after the attack occurs at τ although
only a fraction of bt is nonzero. However, it is shown in the
bottom plot that the proposed detector experiences a considerably
steeper change in the decision statistic, hence is more
sensitive to the magnitude increase of attacking vector than
the first-order CUSUM. This is expected since the first-order
CUSUM test builds on the small bt assumption, and is prone
to efficiency loss for larger bt.
Next, to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed detector
to arbitrary attacking vector, we randomly generate a large
group of bt and examine the successful rates of both detectors
within a fixed time window after the occurrence of attack. For
each group of bt, 105 instances are generated to cover more
diverse attacking behaviors. By successful rate, we mean the
fraction of bt out of 105 that are successfully detected within
the selected time window. The decision thresholds are chosen
such that both detectors meet the constraint E∞[T] ∼= 103.
The following groups of bt and time window are used.
1) b = Pu, ui ∼ U (0.00, 0.02), Window=10, 20.
2) b = Pu, ui ∼ U (−0.02, 0.02), Window=20, 100.
From the first to the second group of bt, we increase the
number of negative components by decreasing the lower limit
of the uniform distribution. Also, to exhibit the robustness
Fig. 3. Decision statistics of the proposed centralized detector and the
first-order CUSUM detector [11] under attack bt∗ (top) and 1.5bt∗ (bottom),
respectively.
of the proposed detector, we plot the success rate along
with different number of attacked meters, whose corresponding
bt entries admit |btm| ≥ γ . As seen from Figs. 4 and 5,
the successful detection rate of the proposed detector always
stays above that of first-order CUSUM detector, indicating its
robustness to a wide range of bt. In particular, the following
observations can be made.
1) The more the attacked meters are, the higher proportion
of the attacking vectors can be detected within the fixed
window, implying a smaller detection delay. This is particularly
true when the window is small, for example,
Window = 10 in Fig. 4.
2) In general, if we increase the window size, successful
detection increases for both methods.
In both groups of bt, the success rate of the proposed
method approaches 100%, regardless of the number of
attacked meters. However, the first-order CUSUM deteriorates
severely in the second group, where more negative bt is generated.
For example, in Fig. 5, even though the window size
is set to be 100, which is impractically large, the first-order
CUSUM detects only less than 50% of generated bt, indicating
lack of robustness.
B. Centralized Detector Versus Distributed Detector
In this section, we examine the performance of the proposed
distributed detector, both with and without level-triggered sampling.
Instead of randomly choosing the attacking vector, we
consider one that is deliberately designed by the attacker with
partial/inaccurate network information. To this end, we assume
that the attacker perceives the measurement matrix H as Ha,
and H = Ha + δ, where δ captures the misinformation at the
attacker's side. Nevertheless, the attacker intends to launch the
perfect attack, that would supposedly bypass the security system
as proposed in [12]. This is also the attacking strategy that
maximizes the impact on state estimation and minimizes the
detectable energy. Denote c as the state estimate error that the
attacker aims to cause, then the injected data is ut = Hact [12],
and b = Put. Note that
bt = PHact = P (H − δ) ct = −Pδc

thus the attacker has made best use of their available information
to limit the detectable b, with no knowledge of δ
at all. In the simulation below, we assume the case where
Ha characterizes the correct network topology, but the branch
parameters deviate from true values by a zero-mean Gaussian
variable with variance σ 2 = 0.1 (recalling that all branches
are assumed to have unit reactance), which could be induced
by real-time environment change, or measurement error. Note
that the attacker does not know the deviation values or their
statistical properties.
The level-triggered sampling threshold is chosen as = 6.
Fig. 6 depicts the decision statistics of proposed centralized
detector and its associated distributed implementation (with
and without level-triggered sampling) under the attack that
occurs at τ = 250. The distributed detector without leveltriggered
sampling refers to the detector (26) based on ADMM
only, i.e., the local statistics are transmitted to the control center
with infinite bits of quantization at every time, as opposed
to the level-triggered sampling where they are transmitted
with single-bit message every random period of time. The
ADMM is implemented with number of iterations equal to
10 and c = 0.4. We see that the decision statistics of the
distributed detectors well approximate the centralized statistic.
Notably, before the attack, the global statistic of the distributed
detector with level-triggered sampling is rarely updated, indicating
small sub-area to control center communication; while
after the attack, frequent updates take place. This demonstrates
the adaptiveness of the level-triggered sampling scheme
to the local information, that is, only necessary information

(with and without level-triggered sampling scheme) detectors, and the firstorder
detector.
is transmitted to the control center. We also plot the statistic
of the first-order detector, which fails to react to the attack,
showing no abrupt change of statistic after τ .
Next, we compare the proposed centralized and distributed
detectors with the sequential detectors in the literature in terms
of average detection delay as false alarm period increases.
In Fig. 7, the conventional fixed-sample-size scheme (black
line with diamond marks) corresponds to repeatedly applying
one-shot false data detector, which is accomplished by
the classical largest normalized residue (LNR) test [28]. It is
seen that the repeated LNR test degrades remarkably as the
false alarm period increases, compared to the other methods

sequential cyber-attack detector using an adaptive sampling
technique called level-triggered sampling. The distributed
detector considerably reduces the communication overhead in
the system, compared to naive approaches, yet preserves the
robustness and high performance of the proposed centralized
detector. Numerical results have demonstrated the considerable
advantages of the proposed centralized and distributed detectors
over existing methods in terms of robustness and average
detection delay performance.

because it disregards the accumulative effect of the attacking
behavior. The black line with squares corresponds to
the centralized detector, which yields the best performance.
The distributed detectors are implemented with the number
of ADMM iterations equal to 10. We again have = 6.
Note that the distributed detector based on level-triggered
sampling performs similarly to the centralized detector, showing
a slight degradation in the detection delay performance
while significantly reducing the communication overhead.
Specifically, for the four sub-areas, the average communication
intervals are [37.5, 94.7, 68.2, 24.4] under normal condition,
and [1.9, 22.1, 25.4, 17.9] under attack. As expected, before
the attack, communication resources are saved by censoring
uninformative data; and after the attack, informative data is
transmitted more frequently. Throughout the procedure, the
information update is realized by single-bit message transmission.
To demonstrate the efficiency of the level-triggered
sampling scheme, we also give the performance of the proposed
distributed detector based on conventional uniform
sampling (dashed line with triangle marks), in which singlebit
quantized local statistics are transmitted with a period
V = 2 (approximately match the minimum average transmission
interval of level-triggered sampling, i.e., that of sub-area
3 under attack). The following simple one-bit quantization
scheme is used: ϕ = sign(g(k ) − g(k−)V ) Q, where we choose
Q = 3. We see that the uniform sampling scheme deviates
from the centralized detector considerably due to the coarse
single-bit quantization. Moreover, the communication intervals
are fixed at V = 2, thus lacking the adaptiveness to the nonuniform
information characteristics before and after the attack.
Note that frequent transmission of local statistics to the control
center wastes the valuable communication resources.
VI. CONCLUSION
We have considered the sequential detection problem of
false data injection attack in smart grid. We have proposed a
centralized detector based on GLR, and showed that it is robust
to various attacking data compared to the existing methods,
and also computationally efficient. For wide-area monitoring
in smart grid, we have further developed a distributed
