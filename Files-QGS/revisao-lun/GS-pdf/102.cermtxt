ABSTRACT
Recent events demonstrated the vulnerability of power grids
to cyber attacks and to physical attacks. Therefore, we focus
on joint cyber and physical attacks and develop methods to
retrieve the grid state information following such an attack.
We consider a model in which an adversary attacks a zone by
physically disconnecting some of its power lines and blocking
the information ow from the zone to the grid's control center.
We use tools from linear algebra and graph theory and
leverage the properties of the power ow DC approximation
to develop methods for information recovery. Using information
observed outside the attacked zone, these methods recover
information about the disconnected lines and the phase
angles at the buses. We identify su cient conditions on the
zone structure and constraints on the attack characteristics
such that these methods can recover the information. We
also show that it is NP-hard to nd an approximate solution
to the problem of partitioning the power grid into the
minimum number of attack-resilient zones. However, since
power grids can often be represented by planar graphs, we
develop a constant approximation partitioning algorithm for
these graphs. Finally, we numerically study the relationships
between the grid's resilience and its structural properties,
and demonstrate the partitioning algorithm on real power
grids. The results can provide insights into the design of a
secure control network for the smart grid.

1. INTRODUCTION
Power grids are vulnerable to cyber attacks [7] and to
physical attacks (e.g., the Apr. 2014 attack on a California
substation [6]). These attacks may cause large-scale failures,
initiate cascades (e.g., [3{5]), and have devastating e ects on
almost every aspect of modern life. As illustrated in Fig. 1,
two main components of the power grid are (i) the physical
infrastructure of the power transmission system (power
lines, substations, power stations), and (ii) the Supervisory
Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system responsible
for monitoring and controlling the grid (we refer to it as the
control network ). Physical attacks target the former while
cyber attacks target the latter.
The e ects of a physical attack can be mitigated, if the
control center has accurate understanding of its impacts and
acts quickly to compensate for failures. However, if physical
attacks are accompanied by cyber attacks that make information
about the status of the attacked zones unavailable,
the control center cannot take e ective action. Hence, in
this paper we focus on developing methods for recovering
the information about the status of the power grid following
a joint cyber and physical attack as well as on studying the
resilience of di erent topologies and the resilience to di erent
attacks.

Figure 2: G is the power grid graph and H is an induced
subgraph of G that represents the attacked zone. An adversary
attacks a zone by disconnecting some of its power lines
(red dashed lines) and disallowing the information from the
PMUs within the zone to reach the control center.
We consider the linearized direct-current (DC) power ow
model 1, a practical relaxation of the alternating-current (AC)
model. We also use a simpli ed version of the control network
model of [28] that includes Phasor Measurement Units
(PMU), Phasor Data Concentrators (PDC), and a control
center (see Fig. 1). We de ne a zone as a set of buses
(nodes), power lines (edges), PMUs, and an associated PDC.
We consider an attack on a zone that disconnects some edges
within the zone (physical attack), and disallows the information
from the PMUs within the zone to reach the control
center (cyber attack). An adversary can perform the
cyber attack by, for example, disabling the zone's associated
PDC. Alternatively, the communication network between
the PMUs and the PDC or between the PDC and the
control center can be attacked.
As illustrated in Fig. 2, as a result of an attack, some
lines get disconnected, and the phase angles and the status
of the lines within the attacked zone H pVH ; EH q become
unavailable. Our objective is to recover the phase angles
and detect the disconnected lines by using the information
available outside of the attacked zone.
The idea underlying many of our results is that power
ows are governed by the laws of physics, where a failure
changes line ows and nodes' phase angles all over the power
grid [40]. We show that based on this physical property, it
is possible to estimate the state in the attacked zone using
the information available outside of the zone. Speci cally,
we use the matrix representation of the DC equations and
the notion of admittance matrix, and apply matrix analysis
and graph theoretical tools to develop methods for retrieving
the information from the attacked zone.
We present necessary and su cient conditions on the structure
of a zone such that our methods are guaranteed to recover
the information. We prove that if there is a matching
between the nodes inside and outside the attacked zone that
covers the inside nodes (VH ), then the phase angles of the
nodes in the attacked zone are recoverable by solving a set
of linear equations of size |VH |. We also prove that if H is
acyclic, then the disconnected lines in H are detectable by
solving a set of linear equations of size |EH |. Moreover, we
show that if H is planar, under some constraints, the discon1The
DC model is commonly used in large-scale contingency
analysis of power grids [14, 15, 37, 49].

nected lines are detectable by solving a Linear Programming
(LP) problem.
We develop another method to simultaneously recover the
phase angles and detect disconnected lines by solving a single
LP problem. We show that if there is a partial matching
between the nodes inside and outside of H, and H is planar,
then under certain constraints on the attack (i.e., on the
disconnected lines), this method is guaranteed to recover the
information. Based on these results, we present the PostAttack
Recovery and Detection (PARD) Algorithm.
We study the problem of partitioning the power grid into
the minimum number of attack-resilient zones (i.e., zones
in which the information can be recovered by the methods
mentioned above). We show that this problem is not approximable
to within n1 for all ¡ 0, unless P=NP. However,
since power grids can often be represented by planar graphs,
we introduce the Zone Selection (ZS) Algorithm and show
that it provides a constant approximation ratio for these
graphs. This algorithm can be used for designing a more
secure control network for smart grids.
Finally, we present numerical results to assess the relationship
between the structural properties of the power grid
and its resilience to joint attacks and to demonstrate the
operation of the ZS Algorithm on several power grids.
The main contributions of this paper are three fold. We
use matrix analysis and graph theoretical tools to: (i) develop
methods to recover the phase angles and detect the
disconnected lines after a joint cyber and physical attack,
(ii) nd graph classes for which these methods are guaranteed
to recover the information, (iii) develop an algorithm
for partitioning the power grid into attack-resilient zones.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews related
work. Section 3 describes the models and reviews
graph theoretical terms. In Section 4, we focus on information
recovery and in Section 5, we study the grid partitioning
problem. Section 6 provides numerical results and Section 7
provides concluding remarks and directions for future work.
Most of the proofs appear in Appendix B.

RELATED WORK
The vulnerability of general networks to attacks was thoroughly
studied in the past (e.g., [8, 31, 36] and references
therein). Speci cally, attacks and failures in power grids
were studied using probabilistic failure propagation models
(e.g., [18, 20, 47], and references therein) as well as using deterministic
DC power ows [12,14,22,32,40]. Malicious data
attacks on the power grid control network were also studied
[21, 30, 33, 44]. However, to the best of our knowledge,
none of the previous works considered power grid vulnerability
to joint cyber and physical attacks.
In Section 4, we study the problem of recovering the phase
angles and detecting disconnected edges after a joint cyber
and physical attack. It is related to the problem of line outages
identi cation from changes in phase angles that was
studied in [42,43]. However, these studies were limited to at
most two line failures. The problem of line failure identi cation
in an internal system using the information from an
external system was studied in [49], which only provided a
heuristic algorithm that was evaluated for only one or two
line failures.
In Section 5, we study the problem of partitioning the
power grid into the minimum number of attack-resilient zones.
This problem is similar to the PMU placement problems
studied in [29,35,48]. Recently, this problem has attracted a
lot of attention in India after the major blackouts of 2013 [29].
In [48] the problem of PMU placement for line outage detection
was studied. However, none of the previous works
considered the problem of PMU placement from the security
point of view and when both the PDC/PMUs and the
physical network can be attacked.
In Section 5, we reduce the attack-resilient zone partitioning
problem to the problem of partitioning a graph into
subgraphs such that each subgraph is (i) acyclic, and (ii)
there is a matching between nodes inside and outside the
subgraph that covers all the subgraph nodes. This problem
is closely related to the problems of vertex arboricity (which
is known to be NP-hard to be determined [26, p.193]) and
k-matching cover of a graph (which can be found in Opn3q
time [45]). However, to the best of our knowledge, the joint
problem was not studied before.
Since the power grid and its robustness have drawn a lot of
recent attention, several performance evaluation tools were
used successfully to analyze power grids (e.g., [25, 27, 34],
and references therein). This paper continues this line of
work, using tools from linear algebra and graph theory.

3.1
MODEL AND DEFINITIONS
DC Power Flow Model
We adopt the linearized (or DC) power ow model, which
is widely used as an approximation for the non-linear AC
power ow model [11]. In particular, we follow [13{15] and
represent the power grid by a connected undirected graph
G pV; Eq where V t1; 2; : : : ; nu and E te1; : : : ; emu
are the set of nodes and edges corresponding to the buses and
transmission lines, respectively. Each edge ei is a set of two
nodes ei tu; vu. pv is the active power supply (pv ¡ 0)
or demand (pv   0) at node v P V (for a neutral node
pv 0). We assume pure reactive lines, implying that each
edge tu; vu P E is characterized by its reactance ruv rvu.
Given the power supply/demand vector p~ P R|V | 1 and
the reactance values, a power ow is a solution P P R|V | |V |
and ~ P R|V | 1 of:
¸

pu; @ u P V
ruvpuv
0; @ tu; vu P E
where N puq is the set of neighbors of node u, puv is the
power ow from node u to node v, and u is the phase angle
of node u. Eq. (1) guarantees (classical) ow conservation
and (2) captures the dependency of the ow on the
reactance values and phase angles. Additionally, (2) implies
that puv pvu. When the total supply equals the total
demand in each connected component of G, (1)-(2) has a
unique solution [15, lemma 1.1].2 Eq.(1)-(2) are equivalent
to the following matrix equation:

the ows, puv, can be obtained from (2).
Notation. Throughout this paper we use bold uppercase
characters to denote matrices (e.g., A), italic uppercase characters
to denote sets (e.g., V ), and italic lowercase characters
and overline arrow to denote column vectors (e.g., ~).
For a matrix Q, qij denotes its pi; jqth entry. For a column
vector ~y, ~yt denote its transpose, yi denotes its ith entry,
}~y}1 : °in 1 |yi| is its l1-norm, and suppp~yq : ti|yi 0u is
its support.
3.2
Control Network
We use the simpli ed version of the model described in [28]
to model the SCADA system to which we refer as the control
network. Fig. 1 illusterates the components of the control
network. We assume that there is a Phasor Measurement
Unit (PMU) at each node of G. The PMU at node i reports
the phase angle i as well as the status of the edges (either
operational or failed ) adjacent to node i. Phasor Data Concentrators
(PDC) gather the data collected by PMUs. The
data gathered by PDCs is sent to a control center which
monitors and controls the entire grid. A zone is a subgraph
induced by a subset of nodes with a single associated PDC.
3.3
Attack Model
We study attacks on power grids that a ect both the physical
infrastructure and the control network. We assume that
an adversary attacks a zone by: (i) disconnecting some edges
within the attacked zone (physical attack), and (ii) disallowing
the information from the PMUs within the zone to reach
the control center (cyber attack). An adversary can perform
the cyber attack by, for example, disabling the zone's
associated PDC. Alternatively, the communication network
between the PMUs and the PDC or between the PDC and
the control center can be attacked. We assume that disconnecting
edges within a zone does not make G disconnected.
Fig. 2 shows an example of an attack on the zone represented
by H. Due to the attack, some edges are disconnected
(we refer to these edges as failed edges) and the phase angles
and the status of the edges within the attacked zone become
unavailable. We denote the set of failed edges in zone H
by F  EH . Upon failure, the edges are removed from the
graph and the ows are redistributed according to (1)-(2).
Notation. Throughout this paper, we denote an attacked
zone by H pVH ; EH q. Without loss of generality we assume
that the indices are such that VH t1; 2; : : : ; |VH |u
and EH te1; e2; : : : ; e|EH |u. We denote the complement
of the zone H by H GzH. If X; Y are two subgraphs of
G, AX|Y and AVX |VY both denote the submatrix of the admittance
matrix of G with rows from VX and columns from
VY . For instance, A can be written in any of the following
2The uniqueness is in the values of puvs rather than us
(shifting all us by equal amounts does not violate (2)).

We use the very same notation for the vectors. For instance
~H and ~H are the vectors of phase angle of the nodes in H
and H, respectively. We use the prime symbol p1q to denote
the values after an attack. For instance, G1, A1, and ~1 are
used to represent the graph, the admittance matrix of the
graph, and the phase angles of the nodes after an attack.
3.4
Graph Theoretical Terms
In this paper, we use several graph theoretical terms and
theorems, most of which are reviewed in Appendix A. We
brie y review some of the important de nitions in this subsection.
Most of the de nitions are borrowed from [16].
Subgraphs, Cuts, and Cycles: Let X and Y be subsets
of the nodes of a graph G. GrXs denotes the subgraph of G
induced by X. We denote by ErX; Y s the set of edges of G
with one end in X and the other end in Y . We denote the
complement of a set X by X V zX. The coboundary of
X is the set ErX; Xs and is denoted by BpXq. Bpvq denotes
the coboundary of X tvu. GrX; Xs denotes the subgraph
of G induced by the edges from ErX; Xs. We say that Q 
E is G-separable, if there are pairwise edge-disjoint cycles
Cqpq P Qq, such that @q P Q; q P Cq [39].
Planar Graphs: A graph G is planar, if it can be drawn
in the plane so that its edges intersect only at their ends. A
planar graph G partitions the rest of the plane into a number
of edgewise-connected open sets called the faces of G.
Given a planar graph G, its dual graph G is de ned as
follows. Corresponding to each face c of G there is a node
c of G , and corresponding to each edge e of G there is an
edge e of G . Two nodes c1 and c2 are joined by the edge
e in G , if and only if their corresponding faces c1 and c2
are separated by the edge e in G. It is easy to see that the
dual G of a planar graph G is itself a planar graph [16].
Incidence Matrix: Suppose we assign an arbitrary orientation
to the edges of G. We denote the set of oriented
edges by E t 1; 2; : : : ; mu. The (node-edge) incidence
matrix of G is denoted by D P t 1; 0; 1u|V | |E| and de ned
as follows,
dij
$'0 if j is not incident to node i;
&
1 if j is coming out of node i;
'% 1 if j is going into node i:
When we use the incidence matrix, we assume an arbitrary
orientation for the edges unless we mention an speci c orientation.
DH P t 1; 0; 1u|VH | |EH | is the submatrix of D
with rows from VH and columns from EH .

ATTACK ANALYSIS
In this section, we study the e ects of an attack and provide
analytical methods for recovering the phase angles and
detecting failed edges in the attacked zone H. We nd conditions
on the structural properties of a zone and constraints
on the failed edges for which these methods successfully recover
the phase angles and detect the failed edges. These
conditions depend on the connections between VH and VH as
well as the inner connections of the nodes in H. Therefore,
we refer to them as external and internal conditions on H,
respectively. Finally, based on the methods, we present the
Post-Attack Recovery and Detection (PARD) Algorithm.
Table 2 summarizes the results regarding the resilience of
a zone based on its internal and external conditions, and
the constraints on the set of failed edges F .
In this section, when we describe our methods, we assume
that there are no edges ti; ju P EH for which i1 j1 (we
refer to these edges as null-edges). Following (2), a null-edge
does not carry any ow. Thus, we cannot detect the status
of those edges since they cannot be distinguished from failed
edges. However, we can detect the null-edges and treat them
separately (we consider this in the PARD Algorithm).
4.1
Recovery of Phase Angles
In this subsection, we introduce a method to recover the
phase angles of the nodes in an attacked zone H. We provide
su cient conditions on GrVH ; VH s such that the method recovers
the phase angles of the nodes in VH successfully. As
we mentioned, since these conditions depend only on the
connections between VH and VH , we refer to them as the
external conditions on H.
The following lemma is the rst step towards designing the
method for recovering the phase angles and for detecting the
failed edges (see Subsection 4.2).
Lemma 1. supppAp~ ~1qq  VH .
Proof. Suppose F tei1 ; ei2 ; : : : ; eik u  EH are the
edges that are disconnected from the grid after the attack
on the zone H. De ne the column vectors x~1; x~2 : : : x~k P
t 1; 0; 1un associated with the failed edges as follows. If
eij tsj; tju then x~j is 1 in its sjth entry, 1 in its ttjh entry,
and 0 everywhere else. It is easy to see that A1 is related
to A as A1 A °jk 1 asjtj x~jx~jt. Since the graph G does
not get disconnected after an attack, the ow equations in
G1 are A1~1 p~. On the other hand, A~ p~, therefore

One of the immediate results of Lemma 1 is the following
corollary. This corollary gives a true statement about ~1
(recall that ~1 is partly unknown). It states that ~1 is in the
solution space of the matrix equation (4).

De nition 1. A zone H is called well-supported, if ~H1 can
be recovered after any attack on H.
Using Corollary 1, the following theorem gives su cient
condition for a zone H to be well-supported.

Thus, ~H1 can be recovered in this case and zone H is wellsupported.

It can be seen that the su cient condition in Theorem 1
depends on the reactance values. However, the following
corollary relaxes the condition in Theorem 1. It shows that
if GrVH ; VH s has a matching that covers VH , then for almost
any reactance values for the edges in ErVH ; VH s, H is
well-supported. The idea is that the set of reactance values
for the edges in ErVH ; VH s for which AH|H does not have
linearly independent columns is a measure zero set in the
real space [38].

In reality, since the reactance values are derived by the
physical properties of the lines, we expect that these values
are relatively random around a mean value. Thus, following
Corollary 2, the existence of a matching that covers every
node in VH is enough for a zone to be well-supported (see
Fig. 3 for an example of a graph in which every node in a
zone is covered by a matching). Hence, in the following sections
we consider the existence of a matching as a su cient
external condition on H to be well-supported.
4.2
Detecting Failed Edges
In this subsection, we assume that after an attack, the
phase angles are recovered using the method in Subsection
4.1 (i.e., by solving (4)). We introduce methods to
detect the failed edges using ~1. We provide su cient conditions
on H such that these methods detect the failed edges

successfully. As we mentioned, since these conditions depend
only on the connections between the nodes in H, we
refer to them as internal conditions on H.
The following Lemma is the foundation for our approach
to nd the failed edges. It limits the set of failed edges to
the solution space of the matrix equation (5). It can be
considered as the complement of Corollary 1.

Lemma 2 provides important information regarding the
failed edges. It states that there exists a solution ~x to (5)
such that suppp~xq reveals the set of failed edges. However,
the solution to (5) may not be unique. The Lemma below
provides a necessary and su cient condition on H such that
the solution to (5) is unique.
Lemma 3. The solution to (5) is unique and suppp~xq
ti|ei P F u, if and only if H is acyclic.
According to Lemma 3 the set of failed edges for any attack
can be detected, if and only if H is acyclic. Fig. 3 shows
an example of a graph and set of zones such that each zone
is both well-supported and acyclic (case I in Table 2).
Although Lemma 3 requires H to be an acyclic graph in
order for the solution of (5) to be unique, by setting some
constraints on the failed edges F , we provide a method to
detect the failed edges in broader class of graphs. The underlying
idea is that the set of failed edges is expected to be
relatively sparse compared to the overall set of edges within a
zone. Thus, we are interested in the solutions of (5) that are
relatively sparse. The l0-norm should be used to capture the
sparseness of a vector. However, since minimizing l0-norm
is a combinatorial problem in general cases, we prefer to
use l1-norm which is known to be a good approximation of
the l0-norm. Thus, we consider the following minimization
problem,

Notice that (6) is still linear and can be solved using Linear
Programming. Moreover, when the solution to (6) also appears
to be sparse, which is usually the case in the considered
scenario, there are very fast algorithms to solve it [23].
The Lemma below states that by solving (6), the failed
edges can be detected in more cases than by solving (5).
The idea that we use in proof of Lemma 4 is the core idea
in proofs of Theorems 2 and 3, as well. Namely, the null

Theorem 3/Corollary 5
space of DH is in one-to-one correspondence with the cycle
space of the graph H. Therefore, there are graph theoretical
interpretations to the solution space of (5). Hence, by using
tools from graph theory and linear algebra, we nd the
solution to (5) with the minimum l1-norm.
Lemma 4. If H is a cycle and |EH X F |   |EH zF |, the
solution to (6) is unique and suppp~xq ti|ei P F u.
Proof. Here without loss of generality, we assume that
DH is the incidence matrix of H when edges of H has
been oriented clockwise. Since H is connected, it is known
that rankpDH q |VH | 1 [9, Theorem 2.2]. Therefore,
dimpNullpDH qq 1. Suppose ~e P R|EH | is the all one vector.
It is easy to see that DH~e 0. Since dimpNullpDH qq 1,
~e is the basis for the null space of D. Suppose ~x is a solution
to (5) such that suppp~xq ti|ei P F u (from Lemma 2
we know that such a solution exists). To prove that ~x is
the unique solution for (6), we only need to prove that
@c P Rzt0u, }~x}1   }~x c~e}1. Without loss of generality
we can assume that x1; x2; : : : ; xk are the nonzero elements

|EH X F |   |EH zF |, therefore k   |EH |{2. Hence, we have

Thus, the solution to (6) is unique.
Corollary 3. If all the cycles in H are edge-disjoint and
for any cycle C in H, |C X F |   |CzF |, then the solution to
(6) is unique and suppp~xq ti|ei P F u.
The following Theorem extends the idea in the proof of
Lemma 4 and provides su cient conditions for failed edges
in a planar graph H to be detected by solving (6) (recall
from subsection 3.4 that H is the dual of the planar graph
H and F is the dual of the set of failed edges).
Theorem 2. In a planar graph H, the solution to (6) is
unique and suppp~xq ti|ei P F u, if the following conditions
hold: (i) for any cycle C in H, |C X F |   |CzF |, and (ii)
F is H -separable.
Fig. 4 shows an example of a zone H for which the set of
failed edges can be detected by solving (6) based on Theorem
2 (case II in Table 2).
The Corollary below states that in planar bipartite graphs,
condition (ii) in Theorem 2 immediately holds, if condition
(i) holds.
Corollary 4. In a planar bipartite graph H, the solution
to (6) is unique and suppp~xq ti|ei P F u, if for any
cycle C in H, |C X F |   |CzF |.

(shown by red dashed lines) that can be detected by solving
(6) based on Theorem 2. The diamond orange nodes are
the nodes of the dual graph H . As can be seen, the dual
of the failed edges can be covered by three edge disjoint
cycles O1 ; O2 ; O3 (shown by dotted lines) in H . Thus, as
Theorem 2 requires, F is H -separable.
Theorem 2 and Corollary 4 are important since power grids
are usually considered to be planar. For instance, lattice
graphs are planar bipartite.
4.3
Simultaneous Phase Angles Recovery and
Failed Edges Detection
In Subsection 4.1 we showed that the phase angles of the
zone H are recoverable, if there is a matching in GrVH ; VH s
that covers VH . However, in reality, this condition might be
very di cult and costly to maintain (i.e., it may require to
increase the number of zones). Therefore, in this subsection,
using similar ideas as in subsection 4.2, we relax the external
conditions on H.
The key idea which is summarized in the following Lemma,
is to combine Corollary 1 and Lemma 2.
Lemma 5. There exist vectors ~x P R|EH | and ~H P R|VH |
such that suppp~xq ti|ei P F u, ~H ~H ~H1 , and

where ~H ~H ~H1 and is known.
From Subsections 4.1 and 4.2 we know that the solution
to (7) is unique, if and only if H is acyclic and AH|H has
linearly independent columns. Therefore, to deal with cases
for which AH|H does not have linearly independent columns,
we consider a similar optimization problem as in (6) but
with more constraints. For this reason, as we mentioned in
Subsection 4.2, since the set of failed edges is expected to
be relatively sparse compared to the overall set of edges, we
consider the following optimization problem,

The following Lemma states that if there is an independent
set of nodes in H with no neighbors in H, then under
some conditions on F , we can recover F and ~H1 by solving
(8) even when AH|H does not have linearly independent
columns (case III in Table 2). First, we de ne innerconnected
nodes.
De nition 2. A node v P VH is called H-inner-connected
if N pvq  VH . It is called H-outer-connected if N pvq 
VH . We denote the set of H-inner-connected and H-outerconnected
nodes by VHin and VHout, respectively.
Lemma 6. Suppose H-inner-connected nodes form an independent
set. If H is acyclic, rankpAH|H q |VH | |VHin|,
and @v P VHin; |Bpvq X F |   |BpvqzF |, then the solution ~x; ~
to (8) is unique. Moreover, suppp~xq ti|ei P F u and
~H ~H ~H1 .
Proof. The idea of the proof is very similar to the proof
of Lemma 4. Suppose ~x; ~H is the solution to (7) such that
suppp~xq ti|ei P F u and ~H ~H ~H1 . From Lemma 5 we
know that such a solution exists. We show that this solution
is the unique solution to (8) in this setting.
Without loss of generality in addition to assuming VH
t1; 2; 3; : : : ; |VH |u and EH te1; e2; : : : ; e|EH |u, we can assume
the labeling of the nodes in G is such that VHin
t1; 2; : : : ; tu is the set of H-inner-connected nodes. Suppose
~ 1; ~ 2; : : : ; ~ t P R|VH | are the coordinate vectors, in other
words ~ i is 1 at its ith entry and 0 everywhere else. It is
easy to see that @i P VHin : AH|H ~ i 0. On the other hand,
since rankpAH|H q |VH | t and ~ is are linearly independent,
~ 1; ~ 2; : : : ; ~ t form a basis for NullpAH|H q.
Assume DH is the incidence matrix of H when its edges
are oriented such that for each i P VHin, the edges are coming
out of i. Now suppose ~z is another solution to (8), it
is easy to see that DH p~z ~xq AH|H ~ for a vector ~ P
NullpAH|H q. Since ~ P NullpAH|H q, there are unique coe cients

for any i P VHin, °j:ejPBpiq d~j AH|H ~ i. If for any i P VHin

we should have c1 c2 ct 0, and ~z ~x. Thus,
~x is the unique solution to (8) and suppp~xq ti|ei P F u.
From the proof, it is easy to see that ~H is also unique.
To generalize Lemma 6, rst let us consider cases in which
H contains H-outer-connected nodes. The Lemma below
shows that the value of for these nodes is unique.
Lemma 7. If v is H-outer-connected and ~H is a solution
to (7), then v is unique and equal to v 1{dpvq °uPNpvq u,
where dpvq is the degree of node v.
In the following theorem, we generalize Lemma 6. This
theorem combines Lemma 6 and Theorem 2, and provides a
broader class of graphs in which solving (8) recovers phase
angles and detects the failed edges after an attack.
Theorem 3. In a planar graph H, the solution ~x; ~H to
(8) is unique with suppp~xq ti|ei P F u and ~H ~H
~H1 , if the following conditions hold: (i) @v P VHin, |Bpvq X
F |   |BpvqzF |, (ii) for any cycle C in H, |C X F |   |CzF |,
(iii) F is H -separable, (iv) in AH|H , columns associated
with nodes that are neither H-inner-connected nor H-outerconnected
are linearly independent, (v) no cycle in H contains
a H-inner-connected node, and (vi) H-inner-connected
nodes form an independent set.
Note that when H is well-supported, there are no H-innerconnected
or H-outer-connected nodes. Thus, conditions (i),
(iv), (v), and (vi) immediately hold and Theorem 3 reduces
to Theorem 2.
Algorithm 1 - Post-Attack Recovery & Detection (PARD)
Algorithm 2 - 3-Acyclic Partition of Planar (3APP)
Input: A connected graph G, phase angles before the attack ~,
and partial phase angles after the attack ~H1 .
1: Detect the attacked zone H by checking for missing data.
2: Compute ~x; ~H the solution to (8) by Linear Programming.
3: Compute ~H1 ~H ~H .
4: Compute F tei|i P suppp~xqu.
5: Detect the set of null-edges that appear after the attack as
N tti; ju P EH | i1 j1 u.
6: return N , F , ~H1 .
Fig. 5 shows an example of a zone H and an attack such
that the phase angles can be recovered and the failed edges
can be detected by solving (8) using Theorem 3 (case IV in
Table 2). As it can be seen, this theorem covers a broad set
of graphs and attacks for which we can recover the phase
angles and detect the failed edges. Notice that here, with
similar argument as in Corollary 2 we can replace condition
(iv) in Theorem 3 with a simpler matching condition as
follows.
Corollary 5. If there is a matching in GrVH ; VH s that
covers VH zpVHin Y VHoutq, then condition (iv) in Theorem 3
holds almost surely.
To conclude, we de ne the attack-resilient and weaklyattack-resilient
notions to summarize the resilience of a zone
to joint cyber and physical attacks.
De nition 3. A zone H is called attack-resilient, if it is
both well-supported and acyclic.
De nition 4. A zone H is called weakly-attack-resilient, if
~H1 and F can be uniquely found after a constrained attack
on the zone H by solving (8).
It is easy to see that an attack-resilient zone is also weaklyattack-resilient.
4.4
Post-Attack Recovery and Detection Algorithm
In this subsection, we present the Post-Attack Recovery
and Detection (PARD) Algorithm for recovering the phase
angles and detecting the failed edges after an attack on a
zone H. Based on the results provided in previous subsections,
if zone H is weakly-attack-resilient, the PARD Algorithm
will recover the phase angles and detect the failed
edges after a constrained attack.
Notice that if there are some failed edges but no data is
missing, then from the data that is gathered by the PDCs
from the PMUs, all the information regarding the status of
the lines and phase angles is available and there is no need
for the algorithm. Thus, as the rst step, the PARD Algorithm
detects the attacked zone H by checking the missing
data (line 1). Then, it solves (8) by Linear Programming
to obtain ~x; ~H . If H is weakly-attack-resilient, from the results
in previous subsections, we know that ~x; ~H are unique,
~H1 ~H ~H (line 3), and F tei|i P suppp~xqu (line 4).
Finally, using ~1 computed in previous line, the PARD Algorithm
detects the set of null-edges N (line 5), and returns
N , F , and ~H1 .

ZONE SELECTION ALGORITHM
In this section we use the results from Section 4 to provide
an algorithm for partitioning the power grid into the minimum
number of attack-resilient zones. From Lemma 3 and
368
Input: A non-empty planar graph G.
1: Find a node v P V such that degpvq ¤ 5.

3: else Find 3-partition of Gzv using 3APP Algorithm as
Q1; Q2; Q3.
4: Add v to the partition that |N pvq X Qi| is minimum.
5: return Q1; Q2; Q3.
Corollary 2, for a zone H to be attack-resilient, it is su cient
that H is acyclic and there is a matching in GrVH ; VH s
that covers every node in VH . Fig. 3 shows an example of
a partitioning such that each zone is attack-resilient. Thus,
we de ne a matched-forest partition of a graph G as follows.
De nition 5. A matched-forest partition of a graph G into
H1; H2; : : : ; Hk is a partition such that for any i, Hi is acyclic
and GrVHi ; VHi s has a matching that covers VHi .
The problem of nding a matched-forest partition of G is
closely related to two previously known problems of vertex
arboricity and k-matching cover of a graph. The vertex
arboricity apGq of a graph G is the minimum number of
subsets into which the nodes of G can be partitioned so
that each subset induces an acyclic graph. It is known that
determining apGq is NP-hard [26, p.193].
A k-matching cover of a graph G is a union of k matchings
of G which covers V . The matching cover number of G,
denoted by mcpGq, is the minimum number k such that G
has a k-matching cover. An optimal matching cover of a
graph on n nodes can be found in Opn3q time [45].
Using these results, we study the time complexity of the
minimum matched-forest partition problem.5 The following
Lemma shows that it is hard to nd the minimum matchedforest
partition of a graph.
Lemma 8. The problem of nding the minimum matchedforest
partition of a graph G is NP-hard.
Moreover, we show that nding the minimum matchedforest
partition is even hard to approximate. We use the
well-known result by Zuckerman [51] that for all ¡ 0, it is
NP-hard to approximate chromatic number to within n1 .
Lemma 9. For all ¡ 0, it is NP-hard to approximate
the minimum matched-forest partition of a graph G to within
n1 .
Despite these hardness results, we provide the polynomialtime
Zone Selection (ZS) Algorithm to nd a matched-forest
partition of a graph. We prove that the ZS Algorithm provides
a constant approximation for the minimum matchedforest
partition of a graph G when G is planar.
Before describing the ZS Algorithm in detail, we rst
describe an algorithm that is used in the ZS Algorithm,
when G is planar. It is known that for a planar graph G,
apGq ¤ 3 [19]. Based on the proof provided in [19], we introduce
a recursive 3-Acyclic Partition of Planar (3APP)
Algorithm. The Lemma below shows the correctness of this
Algorithm.
Lemma 10. The 3APP Algorithm partitions the nodes of
a planar graph G into 3 subsets such that each subset induces
an acyclic graph.
5To the best of our knowledge, this is the rst time that the
problem is studied.

subgraphs that form well-supported and acyclic zones

and in each graph, 100 subgraphs were chosen randomly.
We now present the ZS Algorithm. The ZS Algorithm
rst nds an optimal matching cover M1; M2; : : : ; Mt of G
using an Opn3q algorithm introduced in [45] (line 1). Then,
in lines 2 and 3, it uses this matching cover to partition
V into Q1; Q2; : : : ; Q2t. It is easy to see that for each Qi,
Mri{2s X ErQi; Qis is the matching in GrQi; Qis that covers
nodes in Qi. Then, in order to satisfy the acyclicity
condition on the partitions, it partitions Qis that do not
induce an acyclic graph, into subsets so that each subset
induces an acyclic graph. When GrQis is a planar graph,
it uses 3APP Algorithm to partition GrQis. When it is
not, it uses any greedy algorithm to do so. Thus, the resulted
partition P1; P2; : : : ; Pk satis es the conditions of a
matched-forest partition.
The lemma below states that when G is planar, the ZS
Algorithm provides a constant approximation of the optimal
matched-forest partition. We demonstrate the results
obtained by the algorithm in the following section.

between the structural properties of a grid and its resilience
to joint cyber and physical attacks, and (ii) demonstrate
the results obtained by the ZS Algorithm in several known

of a grid and its resilience to attacks, we quantify the

resilience by the fraction of the node induced subgraphs of
G that form attack-resilient zones. Recall from Section 4
that a zone H is attack-resilient, if it is well-supported and
acyclic. We rst study the relationships between the number
of edges and the fraction of induced subgraphs that form
well-supported, acyclic, and attack-resilient zones. These relationships
can be best demonstrated in random graphs [24],
since by increasing p (the probability that two nodes are connected),
the total number of edges increases.
We generated random graphs with n 30 and n 50
nodes with various p values. For each p, we generated 100
random graphs and in each graph randomly selected 100
subgraphs of size 10. We then computed the fraction of
subgraphs that form well-supported, acyclic, and attackresilient
zones. As can be seen in Fig. 6, as p increases,
the fraction of subgraphs that form acyclic zones decreases
and the fraction that form well-supported zones increases.
In Fig. 6(a), when p 0:14 these two fractions are equal
and the fraction of attack-resilient subgraph is maximized.
As can be seen in Fig. 6(b), the value of p for which these
two fractions are equal (i.e., the fraction of attack-resilient
subgraphs is maximized) decreases as n increases.
We also illustrate the relationships between the size of
the zone |VH | and the fraction of induced subgraphs that
form well-supported, acyclic, and attack-resilient zones. It
is known that scale-free graphs are relatively good representatives
of power grid networks [10], and therefore, we focus
here on such graphs. Fig. 7 shows the relationships in scalefree
graphs with n 30 nodes and m 56 or 104 edges.
As can be seen in 7(a), as the size of the zone increases, the
fraction of zones that are well-supported decreases faster
than the fraction of zones that are acyclic. Thus, the wellsupportedness
is the restricting factor for attack-resilience.
However, this trend is di erent in 7(b). Since the graph has
more edges, as the size of the zone increases, the fraction
of zones that are acyclic decreases faster than the fraction
of zones that are well-supported. Here, the acyclicity is the
restricting factor.
Overall, these results show that the structure of the grid
plays an important role in its resilience and should be considered
when designing a control network.6
6Clearly, random and scale free graphs do not model power
grids perfectly. However, we used them to gain insight into
the relations between structural properties and resilience.
In future work, we will study more realistic network topologies
[41].

into 2 attack resilient zones (using the ZS Algorithm).
We now demonstrate results obtained by the ZS Algorithm
in several known power networks. Table 3 lists the
considered grids and number of resulting partitions. For example,
Fig. 8 shows the partitions obtained by ZS Algorithm
in the IEEE 14-Bus and 30-Bus benchmark systems [2]. As
can be seen, in both cases the graphs can be partitioned into
two attack-resilient zones. We also evaluated the ZS Algorithm
on the IEEE 118 and 300-bus systems, the Polish grid
(available with MATPOWER [50]), the Colorado state grid,
and the U.S. Western Interconnection network.7 For example,
the 6 zones into which the Colorado grid is partitioned
appear in Fig. 9. Recall form Section 5 that when G is planar,
the ZS Algorithm is a 6-approximation algorithm for
the minimum matched-forest problem. However, as can be
seen from the examples above, in practice, it partitions the
networks into few zones.
We note that the ZS Algorithm does not take the geographical
constraints into account. Thus, when partitioning
very large networks such as the Western Interconnection
(see Fig. 10), the nodes in the same partition may be geographically
distant from each other. This is impractical,
since the PMUs from the same zone should send the data
to a single PDC. However, it is easy to see that if a zone is
attack-resilient, any of its subgraphs is also attack-resilient.
Therefore, the partitions obtained by the ZS Algorithm can
be further divided into smaller zones based on geographical
constraints (e.g., into zones within di erent states in
Fig. 10). This approach does not result in an optimal partitioning.
Hence, obtaining an e cient partitioning with
geographical constraints is a subject of future work.

CONCLUSION
We studied joint cyber and physical attacks on power
grids. We developed methods to recover information about

on the disconnected edges for which these methods are guaranteed
to recover the state information. Moreover, we showed
that the problem of partitioning the grid into the minimum
number of attack-resilient zones is not approximable to
within n1 for all ¡ 0 unless P=NP. However, for planar
graphs, we developed an approximation algorithm for the
partitioning problem. Finally, we illustrated via numerical
results the relationship between the structural properties of
the power grid and its resilience to joint attacks as well as
the operation of the partitioning algorithm.
This is one of the rst steps towards understanding the
vulnerabilities of power grids to joint cyber and physical
attacks and developing methods to mitigate their e ects.
Hence, there are still many open problems. In particular,
we plan to generalize Theorems 2 and 3 to a broader class
of graphs. Moreover, we will develop algorithms to partition
the grid into weakly-attack-resilient zones while taking
into account geographical constraints and constraints on the
number and positions of the PDCs. Finally, we will study
the interdependencies between cascading failures in power
grids and its control network when the control network faces
sophisticated cyber attacks.

APPENDIX

PRELIMINARIES
In this appendix we provide some of the known theorems
and de nitions used in the proofs.
A bond of a graph is a minimal nonempty edge cut, that
is, a nonempty edge cut none of whose nonempty proper
subsets is an edge cut.
A graph in which each node has even degree is called an
even graph. A circuit is the union of edge-disjoint cycles. It
is easy to see that a cycle is also a circuit.
Theorem A.1 (Theorem 5.2 [39]). Let G pV; Eq
be a planar Eulerian graph, and let F  E. Then the following
are equivalent: (i) F is G-separable, (ii) for each bond
D, |D X F | ¤ |D F |.
372
Theorem A.2 (Theorem 10.16 [17]). Let G be a connected
planar graph, and let G be a planar dual of G. (i)
If C is a cycle of G, then C is a bond of G . (ii) If B is a
bond of G, then B is a cycle of G .
Theorem A.3 (Theorem 6.1.16 [46]). The followings
are equivalent for a planar graph G, (i) G is bipartite, (ii)
every face of G has even length, and (iii) the dual graph G
is Eulerian.
Theorem A.4 (Euler's formula [16]). For any planar
graph G with n nodes, m edges, r faces, and c connected
components, the following formula holds, n r m c.
Lemma A.1 (Corollary 2.16 [16]). The symmetric difference
of two even subgraphs is an even subgraph.
B. PROOFS
Proof of Corollary 2. Suppose M pU; VH q is the
matching for GrVH ; VH s that covers VH , and suppose U 
VH are the matched nodes which are in VH . Since M is the
matching in GrVH ; VH s that covers H, thus |U | |VH |. Regarding
Theorem 1, to show that H is well-supported almost
surely, we need to show that the columns of the matrix AH|H
are linearly independent almost surely. For this reason, we
show that detpAU|VH q 0 almost surely. detpAU|VH q can
be considered as a polynomial of the nonzero entries of the
admittance matrix using Leibniz formula. Now assume U
tu1; u2; : : : ; u|VH |u are matched to VH tv1; v2; : : : ; v|VH |u
in order. It can be seen that ±|iVH1 | auivi is a term with
nonzero coe cient in detpAU|VH q. Therefore, detpAU|VH q is
not a zero polynomial in terms of its nonzero entries. Now
since the set of reactance values for the edges in ErVH ; VH s
such that detpAU|VH q 0 is a measure zero set in the real
space, thus detpAU|VH q 0 almost surely.
Proof of Lemma 3. It is easy to see that the solution
to (5) is unique if and only if DH has linearly independent
columns. It is known that rankpDH q |VH | c in which c is
the number of connected components of H [9, Theorem 2.3].
Therefore, DH has linearly independent columns if and only
if each connected component of DH is a tree, which means
that DH should be acyclic.
Proof of Theorem 2. Recall that we can assume VH
t1; 2; : : : ; |VH |u and EH te1; e2; : : : ; e|EH |u. We assign an
arbitrary orientation to the edges of H and x the embedding
of H on the plane. We show the set of oriented edges
by EH t 1; 2; : : : ; |EH |u. Suppose H has r faces and
C1; C2; : : : ; Cr are the cycles that surrounded those faces.
For each cycle Ci, de ne vector c~i P t 1; 0; 1u|EH | as follows,
cij

if j R Ci;
if j P Ci and j traverse Ci clockwise;
'% 1 if j P Ci and j traverse Ci counterclockwise:
It is easy to see that @i; DH c~i 0. Therefore, c~i P NullpDq.
On the other hand it is easy to see that c~is are linearly
independent. If c is the number of connected components
of H, then dimpNullpDqq |EH | |VH | c which from
Euler's formula is equal to r. Thus, c~is form a basis for
the null space of the incidence matrix D. Now suppose ~x
is the solution to (5) such that suppp~xq ti|ei P F u (from
Lemma 2 we know that such a solution exists). We need to
prove that for any ~z ~x y1c~1 yrc~r, }~z}1 ¤ }~x}1 i

Thus, there are pairwise edge-disjoint cycles Oj p1 ¤ j ¤ kq the proof of Lemma 6. All we need to prove is that if ~x is

°pPNOpjq |zp| ¥ |xij |. Thus, }~z}1 ¥ °jk 1 °pPNOpjq |zp| ¥

Now we show that }~z}1 }~x}1 is not possible unless
y1 y2 yr 0. If tj1; j2; : : : ; jtu are the indices
for which yj1 yj2 yjt w, then yj1 c~j1
yjt c~jt wc~2 for which from Lemma A.1, c~2 is the vector
associated with the circuit C2 Cj1 Cj2 : : : Cjt ( is
the symmetric di erence). Therefore we can rewrite ~z as
~x w1c~12 w2c~22 wqc~q2 for which w1 ¡ w2 ¡ ¡ wq.
If q 0, then there is nothing left to prove. If q 1,
then it can be easily concluded from Lemma 4 that it is not
possible to have }~z}1 }~x}1 unless w1 0 ñ y1 y2
yr 0. Now assume q ¡ 1, from what we showed
previously, we know that in order to have }~z}1 }~x}1, we
should have }~z}1 °jk 1 °pPNOpjq |zp| °jk 1 |xij | }~x}1.
Equality }~z}1 °jk 1 °pPNOpjq |zp| shows that suppp~zq 
jk 1 NOpjq. Equality °jk 1 °pPNOpjq |zp| °jk 1 |xij | shows
that w1 should appear in }~z}1, half of the time positive and
half of the time negative. However, since w1 has the largest
value, it appears always as w1 wi in the instances like
|w1 wi|. Now from assumption we know that |suppp~xq X
C12|   |C12|{2. Thus, there are more than |C12|{2 instances
like |w1 wi| or |w1| in }~z}1. Therefore, it is not possible
that w1 appears half of the time positive and half of the time
negative in }~z}1, which shows that if q ¡ 1 then }~z}1 }~x}1.
Thus, the proof is complete.
Proof of Corollary 4. H is bipartite, therefore from
Theorem A.3, H is Eulerian. For any C in H, |C X F |  
|CzF |, therefore from Theorem A.2 for any bond C in H ,
|C X F |   |C zF |. Combining these two, from Theorem
A.1 we can conclude that F is H -separable. Thus,
we can simply apply Theorem 2.
Proof of Lemma 5. From Corollary 1 we know that ~H
~H ~H1 is a solution to AH|H~H AH|H~H 0. Now if
~ ~ ~1, from Lemma 2 we know that there exists a vector
~x P R|EH | such that suppp~xq ti|ei P F u and DH~x
~ ~H . Thus, the proof is complete.
AHP|HrooHf oAfHL|eHmma 7. First, notice that since v is H-outerconnected,
N pvq  VH . Thus, v 1{dpvq °uPNpvq u implies
that v is unique. Now, let us compute the vth entry
of the vectors on the both side of the equation DH~x
AH|H~H AH|H~H . Since v is H-outer-connected, the vth
row of DH is a zero vector. Thus, pDH~xqv 0 for any
~x. It is also easy to see that pAH|H~H qv vdpvq and
pAH|H~H qv °uPNpvq u. Since pDH~xqv pAH|H~H qv
wt~bt}1 unless y1 yr w1 wt 0. The
rest of the proof is exactly similar to proofs of Lemma 6 and
Theorem 2. The key is Condition (v) implies that the cycles
(~cis) and coboundries (~bis) are edge disjoint. Thus, since all
the conditions for Lemma 6 and Theorem 2 also hold here,
with exactly the same approach as in the proofs of Lemma 6
and Theorem 2 we can conclude this Theorem.
Proof of Lemma 8. We show that nding the minimum
matched-forest partition is at least as hard as vertex arboricity.
Suppose G pV; Eq is given and we are interested
in apGq. We build a new graph G^ pV^ ; E^q by getting a
copy of graph G, G2 pV 2; E2q and connect every node
in G to its counterpart in G2. Thus, V^ V Y V 2 and
E^ E Y E2 Y ttvi; vi2u|vi P V u. We prove that G^ has a
matched-forest partition of size k if and only if apGq ¤ k.
First, let us assume G^ has a matched-forest partition of
size k, namely H^1; H^2; : : : ; H^k. Since subgraphs induced by
H^1; H^2; : : : ; H^k in G^ are acyclic and partition V^ , it is easy to
see that subgraphs induced by H^1 X V; H^2 X V; : : : ; H^k X V in
G are acyclic and partition V . Thus, apGq ¤ k. Now, let us
assume apGq ¤ k. There should exists a partition of nodes of
G into subsets H1; H2; : : : ; Hk such that each subset induces
an acyclic graph. Assume H12; H22; : : : ; Hk2 are the counterparts
of these subsets in G2. For any i; 1 ¤ i ¤ k 1 de ne
H^i Hi Y Hi2 1, and H^k Hk Y H12. It is easy to see that
H^1; H^2; : : : ; H^k is a matched-forest partition of size k for G^.
Thus, we proved that G^ has a matched-forest partition of
size k if and only if apGq ¤ k. It means that the minimum
matched-forest partition of G^ is equal to apGq, which shows
that the minimum matched-forest partition is at least as
hard as vertex arboricity and therefore it is NP-hard.
Proof of Lemma 9. For a graph G, assume pGq is its
chromatic number. Since each color gives an independent
set of G, induced subgraph by the nodes with the same
color is acyclic with no edges. Thus, it is easy to see that
apGq ¤ pGq. Suppose there is an -approximation algorithm
for the minimum matched-forest problem. De ne
G^ as in proof of Lemma 8. Assume this algorithm partitions
G^ into k subsets. From the proof of Lemma 8, it
is easy to see that k ¤ apGq. On the other hand, since
each acyclic graph has the chromatic number of at most
2, this algorithm gives the 2k coloring of graph G. However,
2k ¤ 2 apGq ¤ 2 pGq. Thus, this algorithm gives
a 2 -approximation of the chromatic number of G. However,
the result by Zuckerman [51] states that for all ¡ 0,
it is NP-hard to approximate chromatic number to within
n1 . Therefore, for all ¡ 0, it is NP-hard to approximate
the minimum matched-forest problem to within n1
as well.
Proof of Lemma 10. It is known that every planar graph
has a node of degree less than or equal to 5 [46]. Therefore,
pAH|H~H qv, we can conclude that v
Thus, the proof is complete.

line 1 of the algorithm can always nd v. At line 4, recursively
we know that subgraphs induced by Q1; Q2; Q3 in Gzv
are acyclic. Now since degpvq ¤ 5, there exists a partition
such that |N pvq X Qi| ¤ 1. Without loss of generality we
can assume that |N pvq X Q1| ¤ 1. Hence, adding v to Q1
does not produces any cycles. Thus, subgraphs induced by
Q1 Y tvu; Q2; Q3 in G are acyclic.
Proof of Lemma 11. Suppose OP T is the minimum number
of matched-forest partitions of G and OP Tm is the number
of optimal matching cover of G. Since for any subset VH
in the partition of G pV; Eq into matched-forest partitions
there exists a matching that covers VH , we can cover V with
OP T matchings. Thus, OP Tm ¤ OP T . Now since G is planar,
ZS Algorithm uses 3AP P to partition Qis into atmost
3 subsets. Hence, if k is the number of subsets returned by
ZS Algorithm then k ¤ 3 2 OP Tm ¤ 6 OP T . Thus,
ZS Algorithm provides a 6-approximation of the minimum
matched-forest partition of G.
As for the running time, ZS algorithm takes Opn3q time to
nd the optimal matching cover of G and Op|Qi|q to partition
Qi. Now since k ¤ n and |Qi| ¤ n, line 4 does not take
more than Opn2q. Thus, the total running time is Opn3q.
