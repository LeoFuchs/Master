Distributed Internet-Based Load Altering Attacks
Against Smart Power Grids
Amir-Hamed Mohsenian-Rad, Member, IEEE, and Alberto Leon-Garcia, Fellow, IEEE
Abstract-With the increase in use of information technology in
advanced demand side management and given the growth in power
consumption in the computation and communications sectors, a
new class of cyberintrusion plans is emerging that aims to alter
the load through the Internet and by means of automatic and distributed
software intruding agents. These attacks work by compromising
direct load control command signals, demand side management
price signals, or cloud computation load distribution algorithms
to affect the load at the most crucial locations in the grid in
order to cause circuit overflow or other malfunctions and damage
the power system equipment. To gain insights into these less-examined
yet important intrusion strategies, in this paper, we identify a
variety of practical loads that can be volnurable to Internet-based
load altering attacks. In addition, we overview a collection of defense
mechanisms that can help in blocking these attacks or minimizing
the damage caused by them. Our simulation results based
on the standard setting in the IEEE 24-bus Reliability Test System
show that our proposed cost-efficent load protection strategy can
significantly reduce the cost of load protection while it guarantees
that no Internet-based load altering attack may overload the power
distribution system.

I. INTRODUCTION
T smart metering, such as two-way communication capabilHE
RECENT advancements in smart grid systems and
ities and distributed intelligence, can significantly enhance efficiency
and reliability [1]. However, they may also create new
vulnerabilities in power infrastructures if they are not accompanied
with appropriate security enforcements. Providing security
for such a large-scale system may seem an unfathomable task,
and if done incorrectly, can potentially leave utilities and the
grid open to a wide range of damaging cyberattacks [2], [3].
An cyberintrusion attempt may target any sector in a power
system: generation, distribution and control, and consumption.
Therefore, depending on the target of attacks, we can identify
three different cyberattack scenarios as shown in Fig. 1. A Type I

cyberattack targets power plants and aims in disrupting or taking
over the operation of generators. Although such attacks are sophisticated
and require significant resources to be successful;
there are multiple reports indicating that such attacks have taken
place in the past. For example, in January 2008, the Central Intelligence
Agency reported knowledge of four disruptions by
hackers of the power suppliers for four cities [3]. Detailed discussions
on possible defense mechanisms against Type I cyberattacks
can be found in [4], [5].
Another class of cyberattacks, i.e., Type II attacks in Fig. 1,
targets power distribution and control. This includes intrusion
attempts for altering phase and other grid state information. For
example, in false data injection attacks against state estimation,
the hackers attempt to compromise measurement sensors
or break into the routers that relay the measured data towards
the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems
in order to insert errors into certain state variable estimations
[6]. A successful attack can potentially cause grid instability
[7]. Some recent algorithms on detecting and preventing cyberattacks
against state estimation are presented in [8]. Other Type
II cyberattacks may include intrusion attempts to the control and
dispatching centers which can cause blackout or damage to the
grid equipment [5].
With the increase in use of information technology (IT) in demand
side management (DSM) and given the growth in power
consumption at the IT, computation, and communications sectors,
a new class of cyberintrusion plans is emerging that alter
the load at certain grid locations through the Internet and by
means of automatic and distributed software intruding agents.
We refer to this class of cyberattacks as Type III attacks. The
target in Type III cyberattacks is the consumption sector. An
attack may involve abruptly increasing the load at the most crucial
locations in the grid in order to cause circuit overflow or
other malfunctioning that can immediately bring down the grid
or cause significant damage to the power transmission and user

equipment. In this paper, we focus on this less-examined yet important
class of intrusion plans. The contributions in our paper
can be summarized as follows.
• We identify a variety of practical loads that can be vulnerable
targets for Internet-based load altering attacks and the
scenarios where the attacks can be successful and cause
major damage to the grid. These loads may include certain
types of computation load as well as the loads in direct and
indirect demand side management programs.
• We overview multiple defense mechanisms that can be
used against Internet-based load altering attacks. They
range from protecting the command and price signals in
direct and indirect load control to load shedding, attack
detection, protecting smart meters, and load relocating.
• Given the high cost of protecting all vulnerable loads in
a large power system, we propose a more practical yet
cost-efficient load protection strategy which minimizes the
cost of load protection while it guarantees that no load
altering attack can cause circuit overflow on any transmission
line. Our design is within an optimization framework
and works by identifying the key locations in the grid
where load protection should be focused on.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we
explain three representative target loads for Internet-based load
altering attacks and discuss how an attack can take place against
each load. A number of defense mechanisms are discussed in
Section III. Cost-efficient load protection is formulated within
an optimization framework in Section IV. Simulations results
are presented in Section V. Conclusions and future work are
discussed in Section VI.
II. LOAD ALTERING THROUGH THE INTERNET
The key idea in Internet-based load altering attacks is to use
the Internet to abruptly increase the load at some carefully selected
grid locations to cause circuit overflow at the most vulnerable
areas of the electric grid. Clearly, not every type of load
can be a target for Internet-based load altering attacks as not
every type of load is accessible through the Internet.
Definition: An Internet-based load altering attack is an attempt
to control and change (usually increase) certain load types
that are accessible through the Internet in order to damage the
grid through circuit overflow or disturbing the balance between
power supply and demand. Internet-based load altering attacks
are expected to be distributed and target a large number of load
and consumption units to be effective.
Next, we discuss three type of loads that are accessible
through the Internet and can be target for load altering attacks.
A. Data Centers and Computation Load
Current estimates suggest that the electricity consumption at
the IT sector is about 2% of the total consumption in the United
States. This share is expected to further increase to about 5%
over the next decade [9]. The electricity consumption at the IT
sector is particularly boosting as cloud computing and the idea
of selling computation power as utility is becoming popular
and the major cloud providers such as Google and Microsoft
are building the world's largest data centers across the United
States and elsewhere [10]. In most cases, a data center includes
Fig. 2. Internet-based load altering attacks can target data centers, direct load
control, and automated energy consumption scheduling units at smart meters.
hundreds of thousands of computer servers, cooling equipment,
and substation transformers. For example, Microsoft's data
center in Quincy, WA, has 43 600 square meters of space and
uses 4.8 kilometers of chiller piping, and 965 kilometers of
electric wire. In total, this data center consumes 48 MW, which
is enough to power 40 000 homes [11]. As another example, the
National Security Agency is planning to build a massive data
center at Fort Williams in Utah, which is expected to consume
over 70 MW electricity [12].
The power load of a data center is highly elastic and depends
on the data center's computation load [13], [14]. In fact,
a data center's energy consumption can almost double when all
computer servers are busy with computation tasks compared to
when the servers are idle. Therefore, data centers can be appropriate
targets for Internet-based load altering attacks as shown in
Fig. 2. While the attacks can be initiated through the Internet and
by overwhelming the data center's computer servers via bogus
computation tasks, the resulting extra power consumption at a
data center can cause major impact to the electric grid due to
abrupt load fluctuations.
B. Direct Load Control
Demand side management and load shaping programs have
been widely deployed over the last two decades. The key idea in
these programs is to modify the load curve shape of customers
by deliberate utility intervention, in order to achieve several objectives,
such as minimizing peak demand, improving system
operation, or maximizing quality-of-service [15], [16]. One of
the most common demand side management programs is known
as direct load control (DLC) in which a portion of the load such
as air conditioning, water heating, refrigeration, and pool pumps
are under the direct control of the utility. One of the largest residential
direct load control systems in the world is currently operated
by the the Florida Power & Light Co. (FPL) in the United
States. It utilizes 800 000 load control transponders and controls
1000 MW of electrical power (2000 MW in an emergency).

669
FPL has been able to avoid the construction of some new power
plants due to their demand side management programs [17].
For a residential direct load control program to be successful,
the system should be made as invisible as possible to the customers.
A storage water-heating program, for example, can be
controlled unnoticed by the customer most of the time. In addition,
it is highly beneficial to use automated load control systems
which are equipped with two-way communications for sending
command signals to the appliances being controlled. In most
cases, command signals include switch on or switch off commands.
Other command signals may also indicate the length of
each on-off cycle or the operational power level to be used by
the appliances. Although it may vary depending on the implementation
approach, DLC command signals are usually sent via
power line carrier [18] or through the Internet [19].
In a Type III cyberattack scenario, the attacker may aim to
compromise the command signals to take over the operation
of the residential and industrial load which are supposed to be
controlled by DLC programs. For example, by simultaneously
sending fabricated switch on signals to a group of thousands
water heating devices, the attacker can cause a major spike in
the aggregate load demand. This can lead to degradation of
the power quality, voltage problems, and potential damage to
utility and consumer equipment if the system is not properly
reinforced. Interestingly, although direct load control has been
studied for decades, there have been limited efforts on understanding
the impact of possible cyberattacks against these programs.
With the recent advancements in smart grid systems and
the increasing use of information technology in power infrastructures,
such attacks are likely to take place, specially in large
scales using sophisticated intrusion techniques.
C. Indirect Load Control
An alternative to DLC is indirect load control, which allows
customers to control their loads independently according to
the price signals that are sent by utilities, e.g., through the
Internet. Home automation and the use of energy consumption
scheduling (ECS) functionality in smart meters have
recieved increasing attention to implement indirect load control
[20]-[23]. Given the price information and based on the energy
consumption needs indicated by users, the ECS units accordingly
schedule the timing and the amont of energy consumption
for each household appliance (see Fig. 2). The appliances that
are controlled may include thermal comfort equipment (i.e.,
heating, ventilating, and air conditioning), washing machines,
plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, and lighting. The decisions
can be made with respect to minimizing the cost of energy,
minimizing the finishing time for the operation of certain
appliances, or achieving a desired trade-off between cost and
timing [20]. The price information can be updated either in
real-time or according to a time-ahead pricing model.
Since the price information is obtained through the Internet,
automated residential load control is exposed to potential load
altering attacks which can be triggered by false price injection.
By compromising the price signals, an attacker can plan to simultaneously
change the energy consumption program in hundreds
or thousands of residences and cause major changes in
the load profile. The amount of changes highly depends on load

demand. A decrease in the price value can cause a major increase on load demand
depending on how elastic the load is with respect to price changes.
elasticity. In general, a decrease in price values results in an increase
in the load demand as illustrated in Fig. 3. Therefore, by
fabricating signals which indicate lower than actual price values
the attacker can cause a major spike in the aggregate load demand.
In this case, the damaging impact to the grid will be major
if there is no mechanism deployed at smart meters to identify
fabricated price information.
III. DEFENSE MECHANISMS AND CHALLENGES
From the discussions in Section II, Internet-based load altering
attacks against smart power grids can take place in a
variety of scenarios. Depending on the scale of the attack, the
damage to the grid can be significant and crucial. In this section,
we overview a collection of defense mechanisms that can help
in blocking this type of cyberattacks or minimizing the damage
caused by them. Here, our focus is to highlight different directions
and possible challenges along the line of each defense approach.
Details on how each defense mechanism can be implemented
and how the listed challenges can be addressed in practice
remain open to future studies.
A. Protecting Command and Price Signals
From Sections II-B and II-C, we can see that a large portion
of Internet-based load-altering-attack work is based on compromising
or fabricating command and price signals in demand side
management programs. On one hand, fabricating the command
messages can affect direct load control. On the other hand, altering
price messages can affect indirect load control and automated
energy consumption scheduling. Therefore, protecting
the command and price messages can reduce the chance of a
Type III cyberattack to be successful. Such protection can be
achieved in different ways. While some approaches are applicable
to both command and price messages, there are also certain
schemes that better fit the special protection needs for each
of the two types of signals.
In direct load control, command messages are usually transmitted
as unicast. That is, each command is exclusive to a particular
user. For example, when a command message indicates
670

Fig. 4. The command messages sent by utility can be authenticated by using a
private key encryption and message authentication code generation.
the operational power level for a particular appliance, such command
may not be applicable to all users. Instead, it may aim for
one user or one chosen group of users. Moreover, the switch
on and switch off cycles are not usually synchronized among
all users to avoid unwanted spikes in load demand. Therefore,
command message transmission is usually a one-to-one communication.
One approach to protect command signals is to use
private key encryption and message authentication code (MAC)
generation as shown in Fig. 4. Various standard encryption algorithms
such as RSA [24] can be used. Some details on private
key encryption and related implementation issues can be found
in [25].
On the other hand, in indirect load control, price signal transmissions
are usually multicast as the price is announced to all
users. Nevertheless, there is still a critical need for protecting
the price signal. In fact, while we want all users to be able to receive
and understand the price signals, we want to block any user
from regenerating the price signals. From this and knowing that
some demand side management programs encourage message
exchanges not only between utility and users but also among
users themselves [21], [23], there is a need to implement an efficient
group key management between the utility and its corresponding
users. This can be done, for example, by simple pairwise
key management, which is similar to the structure we already
saw in Fig. 4. However, depending on the grid topology
and the pricing model, there can be a need for more scalable and
computationally efficient schemes such as distributed or hierarchical
group key management methods [26], [27].
B. Protecting Smart Meters and Data Centers
Besides direct protection of the price and command signals
from being fabricated by unauthorized sources, we also require
to protect the smart meters themselves from intrusion.
In a recent study on advanced metering infrasttructure, the
cybersecurity issues of smart meters are identified within
four categories of confidentiality, integrity, availability, and
accountability [28]. Both integrity and availability concern
unauthorized modification or access to the normal operation of
the smart meters by means of setting up passwords, firewalls,
and identity authentication. Clearly, the chance for a cyberattack
to be successful can be significantly reduced in a reinforced
metering infrastructure where both the meter and the incoming
price and command signals are being highly protected. In a
similar way, data centers need to be protected against bogus
computation tasks, flooding, and denial-of-service attacks.
C. Attack Detection and Learning Demand Patterns
While the defense mechanisms that we explained in
Sections III-A and III-B intend to prevent load altering attacks,
we also need strategies to block a successful intrusion
from causing a major damage to the grid. In this regard, a
regional grid operator or a utility may attempt to curtail an
affected load at certain buses through the use of aggregators,
substations, and circuit breakers. However, any action of this
kind requires to first carefully identify which load has been
compromised. This can be done, for example, by learning
the normal demand pattern for each type of residential or
commercial load at each region. That is, by keeping track of
the daily and hourly load at each power consumption sector
and looking for any behavior which demonstrates significant
mismatch with the normal trend for that particular load. As an
example, most measurements suggest that residential peak load
is usually around 5:00 P.M. to 11:00 P.M. while the industrial
peak load is around 7:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M. [27]. Therefore, if an
aggregator observes a sudden increase for a group of houses on
a weekday at 10:00 A.M., then it can become suspicious about
a potential cyberattack to the automated energy consumption
scheduling units in that neighborhood. This simple example
can be extended to more sophisticated and multilayer detection
scenarios. Given a load altering attack detection alarm, the
aggregator can set up a quick authentication process with the
suspected smart meter and possibly consider load shedding as
the final step, when the grid is indeed at risk, as we will discuss
next.
D. Load Shedding and Load Relocating
If the grid and power transmission equipment are at risk due
to excessive load demand, load shedding is an inevitable option.
An immediate action could be shutting down automated
load scheduling or curtailing the load at locations where an load
altering attack is detected with a high probability. This will not
affect the operation of the rest of the grid, but there is still a need
for a chain of actions to bring the affected load into normal operation.
The next step, could be shedding other load at the most
crucial grid locations while taking into account different classes
of load contracts and the cost of load shedding [29], [30].
In certain scenarios, load relocating can replace load shedding,
where instead of curtailing a load, we move it from one
location to a different grid location to make the load distribution
more balanced and to reduce the load at buses that are overloaded.
One example for the load that can be relocated is the
load at the computation sector, which can be moved through the
Internet from one data center to another data center somewhere
else in the grid. Therefore, while the IT loads can be potential
targets for Internet-based load altering attacks, if they are well
protected, they can instead help the grid in load relocating. Recent
results on the coordination of computation sector and the
smart grid can be found in [31].
IV. COST-EFFICIENT LOAD PROTECTION
Applying the defense mechanisms from Section III can prevent
load altering attacks, but they also impose new costs to the
grid operators. In fact, depending on the type of load and the
choice of defense mechanisms being implemented, the cost of a
full load protection, i.e., protecting all vulnerable loads, can be
significant. Therefore, in practice, the grid operators may choose
to implement partial load protection. In that case, they need to
carefully identify the most critical locations in the electric grid
and protect the load only at those locations. This leads to the
following design problem. Given the prior knowledge about the
grid topology, the locations of loads, the type of load at each
location, locations and capacities of generators, and nodal admittance
and the capacity of all power transmission lines, we
need to identify the portion of the load to protect against Internet-based
load altering attacks such that the cost of load protection
is minimized while ensuring that the remaining unprotected
load cannot cause circuit overflow or any other major
harm to the electric grid. In this section, we solve this problem
within an optimization framework.
A. System Model
Let denote the set of all buses in the grid. For each bus
, let denote the amount of active generation power at bus .
Also let denote the amount of normal active load power at bus
, that is, the load when no load altering attack is taking place.
Similarly, we assume that denotes the maximum amount of
extra active load power that can be added to bus in the absence
of any load protection. Moreover, we assume that the portion of
the extra load at bus which is being protected is denoted by .
Note that . If no protection is used at bus , then the
total altered load can be as high as , i.e., the whole vulnerable
load. However, if portion of the vulnerable load at this bus is
protected, then the total altered load will be . Thus,
the total active load power at bus is obtained as
Clearly, if the active power generation is greater than the active
power load, then will be a negative number. Next, assume
that denotes the voltage phase angle at bus and denotes
the imaginary term in the complex value at row and column
of the -bus matrix of the grid. We also denote as the power
flow over each branch in the electric grid where .
Focusing on the per-unit setting of power systems, we can derive
dc power flow equations as follows [32]:
and
In order to solve the system of linear equations in (2) and (3),
it is required to take one voltage phase angle as reference. For
example, we may assume that . In that case, and given the
values of , , , , and for all buses and all branches
in the grid, solving (2) and (3) will uniquely identify all voltage
phase angles and all branch power flows.
B. Problem Formulation
Let denote the power transmission capacity of branch
. In order to avoid circuit overflow, it is required that
From (2) and (3), whether circuit overflow occurs depends on
the amount and the distribution of load across different buses in
the electric grid. Without loss of generality, we assume that no
circuit overflow occurs if for all . That is, the
power transmission capacity of the branches are enough as long
as no load altering attack is taking place. Next, we find the best
choice of load protection level for all buses such that
we can minimize the cost of load protection.
Let denote the cost of load protection at bus .
We assume that the cost is an increasing function of the protection
level . If then . That is, if no load
is being protected at bus , then no cost would be associated to
the load protection at this bus of the electric grid. The cost of
load protection grows as increases. If , then full load
protection is being implemented at bus . We are now ready to
formulate cost-efficient load protection as the optimal solution
of the following optimization problem:

(6)
Here, the optimization variables are the load protection levels
at all buses, i.e., the entries in vector . By
solving (5), we determine the amount of load protection at each
bus to minimize the total cost of load protection.
C. Solution Approach
The complexity of optimization problem (5) mostly depends
on the type of the cost functions for all buses . A
class of cost functions which is practical and can also lead to
tractable formulation of problem (5) is the family of piecewise
linear functions as shown in Fig. 5. In this setting, we divide the
load to be protected at each bus into several classes depending
on their cost to be protected. Let denote the number of such
load classes at bus . After sorting these classes in an ascending
order with respect to the cost of protection, we define class
indicators , where
Starting with the case when no load is protected, the cost of
protection increases linearly as we protect more load and we
increase from zero to . When all the load in the class
with the lowest cost of protection is secured then we move on to
the next load class, which has a higher cost of protection. This
procedure can continue by further increasing until we finish
protecting the class with highest cost of protection and reach the
full load protection level, if necessary. Given piecewise linear
cost functions, optimization problem (5) can be formulated as

such as the interior point method [33].
V. NUMERICAL EXAMPLE
A. Setting
Consider the power grid in Fig. 6. This is a modified version
of the IEEE 24-bus reliability test system in [34]. It includes
24 buses and 38 branches. There are 10 buses with generation
capacities. The generation capacity is fixed at nine buses.
The generator at bus 22 works as a spinning reserve [32]. That

is, at each time, it provides the extra generation capacity that
needs to be injected into the grid in order to balance supply
and demand. There are 18 buses with different amounts of load
demand. Among them, in 10 buses the load is not accessible
through the Internet and there is no risk of Internet-based load
altering attack. However, there exist various loads that are vulnerable
to load altering attacks at the other eight buses. The location
of these buses are highlighted by a separate numbering in
Fig. 6. The generation capacities and the load demand parameters
at all buses are shown in Table I.
There are four data centers connected to the electric grid at
buses 1, 13, 15, and 18. The energy consumption parameters
for all data centers are assumed to be the same as those reported
in [13] and [31]. Therefore, for each data center, the normal load
and the peak load are assumed to be 50 MW and 100 MW, respectively.
There are also four demand side management units
connected to the grid at buses 3, 7, 20, and 23. Automated load
control is assumed to be direct at buses 7 and 20 and indirect
at buses 3 and 23. For the purpose of our study, we assume that
for all buses that serve the demand side management units, the
normal load is 50 MW while the peak load is 100 MW. For all
loads that are vulnerable to the Internet-based load altering attacks,
we assume that the load protection cost function is piecewise-linear.
Without loss of generality, we assume that
and for all . The slope
of the piecewise-linear cost function increases by 50% for the
portion of the load which has a higher cost of protection. Finally,
we assume the use of underground monopole high voltage direct
current transmission lines in the considered grid, where for
each branch of the grid we set MW.

B. Cost-Efficient Load Protection
Based on the simulation setting described in Section V-A, we
first compare the three cases of full load protectioin, optimal
cost-efficient load protection, and no load protection. The results
are shown in Fig. 7, where we plot the power flow amounts
on the three highly congested transmission lines for each load
protection scenario. We can see that if no load protection is
being implemented there will be one transmission line with a
power flow over 440 MW, which is significantly higher than the
assumed capacity of the transmission lines. It corresponds to the
branch (17, 16) in the grid in Fig. 6. On the other hand, a full
load protection can assure no extra load on any of the eight buses
with accessible load through the Internet. However, we can see
that even a partial yet efficient load protection approach can be
sufficient to limit the power flow across all grid branches below
their transmission capacities. In a cost-efficient load protection
scenario, we have , , and . In
addition, for all . That is, in order
to assure that no Internet-based load altering attack can cause a
circuit overflow, it is enough to only protect half of the computation
load at bus 13, half of the directly controled load at bus
20, and a quarter of the indirectly controlled load at bus 23. The
cost in this case is only 10.2% of the cost in full load protection.
C. Impact of Changes in Grid Parameters
In general, the cost of efficient load protection against Internet-based
load altering attacks depends on various grid parameters
such as the capacity of transmission lines, as shown in
Fig. 8. In this figure, the costs are normalized with respect to
the cost of full load protection. We can see that the cost drops
as the capacity of transmission lines increases. As an example,
for the case when the line capacity is 310 MW, the optimal load
protection variables are obtained as , ,
, , , and while
we have for all . As another
example, for the case when the line capacity is 430 MW, the optimal
load protection variables are and for all
. In fact, the direct load control system connected

generator with spinning reserve capacity across the electric grid.
to bus 7 is the most critical load to be protected against load altering
attacks for the grid scenario in Fig. 6.
Next, we investigate the cost of load protection when the location
of spinning reserve generator changes. Recall that in our
simulation setting, the spinning reserve generator is used to balance
supply and demand and to incorporate the changes in the
load due to potential Internet-based load altering attacks. The
results are shown in Fig. 9. Here, we assume that the line capacities
are 400 MW. We can see that depending on where we
place the spinning reserve generator, the normalized cost of required
optimal load protection can be as low as zero (as in the
case when we place the spinning reserve generator at buses 1,
2, , 6) or as high as 16% of the full load protection cost. This
is yet another example showing that an efficient load protection
should necessarily take into account the grid topology and various
other grid parameters.
VI. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we took a first step towards understanding the
Internet-based load altering attacks against smart power grids.
In this regard, we studied different scenarios where a load can be

altering attacks. We identified three important classes of vulnerable
load scenarios: data centers and computation load, direct
load control, and indirect load control. We showed that an attack
may take place by compromising the direct load control
command signals, indirect load control price signals, or cloud
computation load distribution algorithms. Therefore, useful defense
mechanisms can range from protecting the command and
price signals to load shedding, attack detection, and load relocating.
Given the high cost of protecting all vulnerable loads in
a large power system, we proposed a cost-efficient load protection
strategy which minimizes the cost of load protection while
it prevents overloading the grid.
