Analytical analysis of cyber attacks on unmanned aerial
systems
Abstract
Cyber security has emerged as one of the most important issues in the operation of
Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) due to their heavy reliance on the on-board autopilot
systems. As the first step to implement an autopilot system that is robust to possible cyber
attacks, we have conducted a study to identify potential cyber threats and vulnerabilities
inherent in the given UASs. In an attempt to study these vulnerabilities in more detail, this
paper presents an analytical algorithm to test the behavior of UASs under various cyber
attacks and quantify their severity accordingly. Compared to a numerical approach, the
analytical algorithm enables the prediction of the most effective cyber attack combinations
without the need to compute the severity of all the attack combinations, thereby greatly
reducing the computational cost. The performance of the proposed algorithm is
demonstrated with a linearized longitudinal motion of a rotorcraft example.
