Multiact Dynamic Game Strategy for Jamming
Attack in Electricity Market
Jinghuan Ma, Yuting Liu, Lingyang Song, Senior Member, IEEE, and Zhu Han, Fellow, IEEE
Abstract- As the current power grid system is upgrading to
the smart grid, it becomes more vulnerable to security attacks
on its communication subsystem such as the denial-of-service
attack. Jamming, as a kind of denial-of service attack, can be
applied to interfere the real-time communication in smart grid.
In this paper, we analyze the scenario in which the attacker can
jam a reduced number of signal channels carrying measurement
information in order to manipulate the locational marginal price
and create the opportunity for gaining profit, and the defender
is able to guarantee a limited number of channels in information
delivery. Based on the electricity marketing model, we propose
a multiact dynamic game between the attacker and defender, in
which the optimal strategies are taken by the two sides to maximize
their own profits. We study the gaming process and discuss
the prosperities of the outcome. Simulation results present the
affect of jamming attack on the electricity prices and the gained
profits of the two sides. Moreover, they confirm the optimality
of the proposed scheme in pursuing profit.

I. INTRODUCTION
S grating power infrastructures with communication techMART
GRID is an emerging cyber-physical system intenologies
[1]. The well-deployed sensor network in the smart
grid provides observations to identify the current operating
state such as the transmission line loadings and bus voltage,
and strongly supports the online monitoring and state estimation
[2] by control center [such as supervisory control and data
acquisition (SCADA) center] to guarantee a reliable operation
of the power system. However, attacks on the cyber-physical
system can cause malfunctions of the electricity market or the
power system [3]. As for the physical side, a novel electrical
topological model based on weighted undirected graph is

proposed for structural vulnerability analysis of power grids
in [4]. In [5], a hybrid approach on complex networks has
been proposed to analyze the structural vulnerability of power
transmission networks. Meanwhile, a number of researches
have been conducted over cyber security for smart grid [6][9].
Liu et al. [6] presented an undetectable attack method
based on the Jacobian matrix. The design method of information
security protection architecture in U.S. smart grid and
information security protection requirements of China smart
grid were analyzed in [7]. In [8], based on the hierarchical
information and communication model, the information security
risks and information security protection demands of smart
grid were studied. In [9], a novel criterion of reliable strategies
for defending power systems was derived and two allocation
algorithms were developed to seek reliable strategies.
Specifically, the denial-of-service (DoS) attack on communication
infrastructure in the smart grid is a severe threat,
in which the attacker tries to prevent the remote sensors
from sending measurement information to the control center,
causing the instability of the power system or even regional
blackout. One of the DoS attacks is the jamming on the physical
layer of the grid's communication networks [10], [11].
Until now, many works have been done over jamming attacks
in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) [12]-[16], but few have
paid attention to the jamming attack in smart grid. During
the attack, the jammer emits undesired signals to the communication
channel to interfere the ongoing measurement data
transmission, resulting in the incompleteness of the received
real-time measurement information in the control center. Due
to the jamming, the online monitoring and state estimation
may fail to reflect the actual operating state of the system,
and the corresponding electricity price will be calculated in
error [17], [18]. Common consumers and the power supplier
may suffer an economic loss from deploying the false electricity
prices, while the jammer can profit from the price
gap in the electrical power market. Hence, it is critical
to ensure the grid system's robustness against the jamming
attack.
The jamming attack, in general case, always lasts for a
long term. Once the attack is launched, the detection module
equipped with sensor nodes is triggered to inform the control
center for countermeasures. However, when the control
center responds to take action after the detection, the attacker
can further change the jamming targets to continue its attack.
Instead of reacting to the detected jamming, with the dense and
well-organized WSN in smart grid, the control center can take
preset measures to guarantee the transmission of measurement

information, considering the fact that an jammer with limited
attacking choices intends to attack the a bus with higher
reward.
Thus, the attacker and the control center constitute a game,
where the participators choose a limit number of buses out of
the bus system to attack/guarantee the transmissions of measurement
information. To analyze the attacker and defender's
strategies, the game theoretic approaches have been applied
in smart grid to simulate the optimization of the strategy
choices during the attack [19]-[21]. In this paper, we divide
the whole attack and defense process into time slots, each of
which is defined as an independent level, where both attacker
and defender decide their strategies based on their observation
and prediction to attain optimal profit. The backward induction
algorithm for finite dynamic game provides optimal strategies
for the players in all stages during a long-term gaming, and is
adopted in this paper to tackle the jamming attack and defense
problem. Our contributions are summarized as below.
1) We study the impact of the jamming attack on the
electricity market and propose countermeasures to antagonize
attacks for security in smart grid.
2) We adopt the multiact dynamic game and investigate the
strategy equilibrium between the attacker and defender.
We propose a backward induction-based algorithm to
find the saddle-point solutions in all the levels and thus
achieve the Nash equilibrium solution of the dynamic
game.
3) The simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the
proposed algorithm over the PJM five-bus test system.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The
system model is provided in Section II. The elements of
the proposed game are defined in Section III, and the Nash
equilibrium is analyzed in Section IV. The numerical results
is provided in Section V and the conclusion is provided in
Section VI.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
In this section, we study the power state estimation in transmission
system, which provides the real-time information of
power demand and generation. Then, we investigate the pricing
mechanism optimal power flow (OPF) and the locational
marginal price (LMP) that have been applied in the electricity
market.
A. Power System State Estimation
In the state estimation, the control center obtains the observation
of m real-time measurements from n sensors among
the network with phase angles φi. Since the voltage phase
(φi) of a reference bus is fixed and known, we only have
to estimate (n − 1) left unknown. We define the state vector
as φ = [φ1, . . . , φn]T and the observed vector P for m active
power measurements [22], related with the active power, which
can be described as follows [23]:
P = p(φ) +
(1)
where P = [P1, . . . , Pm]T denotes the vector of measured
active power in transmission lines, p(·) is the nonlinear relation
The bad data can be injected to P to impact the state estimation
of φ. Given the power flow measurements P, the estimated
state vector φˆ can be computed as
φˆ =
HT
−1H
−1 HT
−1P = BP
−1H −1 HT
where B = H HT −1.
The false data detection can be performed with the residue
vector r computed from the difference between measured
vector and the estimated value based on the endogenous
parameters: r = P − Hφˆ . With the given threshold value for
test whether the cyber has been attacked, the hypothesis of not
being attacked should satisfy [24]
miax |ri| ≤ γ .
B. DC OPF and LMP
OPF is adopted to provide the constraints of optimization
of electricity allocation in power systems. The locational
marginal pricing methodology has been the primary approach
in electricity markets to set electricity prices and deal with
transmission congestion. On the basis of the OPF model,
LMPs are classified into tow types: 1) day-ahead LMP; and
2) real-time market.
1) Day-Ahead LMP: The linear form of dc OPF to predict
the day-ahead electricity price in the market is proved to
be effective in generation prescheduling with static parameters
[25]-[27]. Then, LMP at each bus of the power network
is decided by the linear programming solution of the problems
described as
between measurements, φ denotes the vector of n bus phase
angles φi, and = [ 1, . . . , m]T is the Gaussian measurement
noise vector with covariant matrix . The Jacobian matrix
H ∈ Rm is defined as
Since the phase difference (φi − φj) is small, (1) can be
reduced to the following linear approximation:

for the electricity, which is a one-variable function of the
measurement P.
In the day-ahead market, the general formulation of LMP at

the delivery factor at bus i. In order to emphasize the main
part of LMPi, we assume that the optimization model in (7)
ignores losses, and we have DFi = 1 and LMPlioss = 0 in (10).
Thus, LMPi can be described as

LMPi = λ +

2) Real-Time LMP: In the real-time market, an ex-post
market model is based on the run time data. The realtime
LMP in the real-time market is deduced from the dc
Optimal Power Flow (DCOPF) model with the change of
value in power flow on each bus for the real-time electricity
dispatch, which satisfies the following incremental linear

III. JAMMING ATTACK AND DEFENSE
A. Jamming Attack Procedure
Manipulating the prices in electricity market is the incentive
for the jammer to launch the attack. The pricing mechanism
depends on the state estimation from the sensors.
However, when being jammed, the measurements from state

linear model as

estimators are unavailable to the control center [29]. We adopt
a discrete-time model of jamming attacks, in which time is
divided into time slots. We note that the jammer will only
attack a limited number of sensors out of the whole WSN in
smart grid, mainly because of the following.
1) An excessive jamming attack can cause power blackout,
resulting in failure to manipulate the price.
2) A wide-area jamming attack will seriously increase the
risk of being detected.
The procedure of jamming attack is given below.
1) At the beginning of a time slot, the attacker jams specific
channels in the network to cause measurements
unavailable, leaving real-time prices at corresponding
buses (LMˆPiRT ) undecided.
2) The control center will use default values to substitute
lost measurements for the dc OPF model.
3) The attacker keeps monitoring the power market and
jamming the insecure measurements during a whole time
slot.
4) With the access to real-time measurements, the attacker
can predict real-time prices after ceasing the jamming.
5) Comparing the real-time during and after jamming, the
attacker will buy electricity at lower price and sell
electricity at higher price to profit from the difference
between two prices.
B. Jamming Attack Strategies
pˆij =
φi − φj

(Bi − Bj)T

P = MT P
(15)
where MT = (Bi − Bj)T /Xij, Bi, and Bj are the ith and jth
components of the vector denoted in (4), respectively. Based
on (13), we can find the linear relation between pˆij and P,
which is an N-dimensional vector reflecting the measurement
of the voltage angle on different transmission lines.
1) During Jamming: With no state estimation received
from equipments during the jamming attack, the control center
substitutes the default value Pdef for sensors jammed by the
attacker. Once the control center detects the lost signals, the
default values are required for DCOPF to price the electricity
in the market. Consequently, the lost demand datas in (12)
Di are replaced by the predetermined values Di(Pdef).
The optimal result with the constraints with default values
can be deduced from the DCOPF model, given LMPijam

(16)

It is proved that default values of measurements jammed
can directly impact assumed values of transmitted power. The
optimal dispatch strategy based on the incorrect assumption
leads to the deviation of the electricity price in the market
during jamming attacks.
2) After Jamming: At the end of a time slot, the attacker
ceases jamming, so the control center receives the real-time
estimation again. The DCOPF program decides the real-time
2276

price when sensors report the changes in measurements among
the grid. Then, the price during the jamming is obviously different
from the real-time price. The inequality condition after
jamming is altered in the form as

where P is an N-dimensional measurement that the control

where L is the gross profit for per unit of electricity that the

C. Defense Strategies
We investigate the existing countermeasures against jamming
attack in WSN and study the techniques applicable for
WSNs in smart grid. Li et al. [29] proposed an anti narrowband
jamming technique where the remote sensor can utilize
multiple channels to deliver information and avoid the jamming
interference. Cagalj et al. [30] traded-off the network
robustness with its complexity and cost, and assigned a portion
of pairs of sensor nodes, one of which is out of the jammed
area, to create wormhole communication links to pass the
information out of a jammed area. Xu et al. [31] utilized channel
surfing method involving on-demand frequency hopping to
defend jamming attack, and studied two different approaches
to channel surfing. The coordinated channel switching requires
the entire sensor network to adjust its channel while the spectral
multiplexing assigns the nodes in a jammed region to
switch channels and nodes on the boundary of a jammed
region as radio relays between different spectral zones.
As smart grid manages to develop a large-scare WSNs [32],
it is feasible to deploy alternative sensors to monitor the state
of a bus and create multiple paths to deliver the measurement
information. The techniques of wireless power transfer and
energy harvesting will enable the sensors in smart grid to carry
a long-term monitoring service [33]. Hence, the control center
is able to adopt the available anti-jamming techniques in the
WSNs in smart grid. For considerations on energy saving, in
each monitoring round the control center will only assign a
limit number of bus to utilize the defense strategies in data
transmissions.

IV. ATTACKER AND DEFENDER GAMING
In this section, we firstly introduce the single-act game solutions
in both pure strategy and mixed strategy. Then we turn
to the dynamic game with multiple stages and specifically
construct the recursive algorithm to analyze behaviors in the
electricity market.
A. Single-Act Games in Extensive Form
The multiact dynamic game of complete information consists
of a series of single-act games of complete information in
the time order, where a single-act game is also named a subgame
[34]. We note that the symbols for defining a single-act
game will contain subscripts and superscripts, for which we
regard it as a sub-game of the dynamic game based on which to
further introduce the entire dynamic gaming process. A singleact
two-person zero sum game is defined as Gk,1 in which the
two players, denoted, respectively by S1 and S2, compete with
each other for more profit given the zero sum of gains [35].
As the extensive form is convenient to display the process of
a multistage game, we also adopt this form to introduce the
single-act game besides matrix form.
A single-act two-person zero-sum game is structured as a
finite tree, as shown in Fig. 1. The basic structure in the tree
is a node indicating the action stage of a player with branches
representing every possible strategy of the player. The branch
may point to another node representing the action stage of the
other player, or to a payoff value indicating the end of the
game. Let Pij denote the jth strategy of player i and i denote
tshtreatsetgraietesg,yansdet o2f =i. {P121,=. .{.P,11P, n1.}... T,Phe1m}g,aim.ee., aSll1owhassptloatyaellrys tmo
act successively or simultaneously. In this scenario, we assume
that the attacker and defender choose their strategies simultaneously.
S2 does not know S1's strategy when choosing its own
strategy. We model this by encircling all the stage nodes of S2
that correspond to S1's possible actions with the dashed lines.
The payoff function maps a strategy pair {P1m, Pn2} uniquely to
a payoff vector akmn represents the gained profits of the players.
The matrix form of the game is given in Table I. Each entry
of the matrix amn corresponds to an end point assigned by a
particular pair of strategies {P1m, Pn2} taken by both players, all
of which represent the payoffs of the game Gk.
1Gk also represents the kth level sub-game of the dynamic game.
MA et al.: MULTIACT DYNAMIC GAME STRATEGY FOR JAMMING ATTACK IN ELECTRICITY MARKET
TABLE I
kTH SINGLE-ACT GAME Gk IN MATRIX FORM
Let J(γ 1, γ 2) ≥ 0 denote the attacker's profit by successful
attack [−J(γ 1, γ 2) is the defender's loss] where γ 1 ∈ 1 and
γ 2 ∈ 2, so that amn = J(γ 1 = P1m, γ 2 = P2n). Here, we do
not include the cost of launching jamming attack in the game,
so that J(γ 1, γ 2) is nonnegative. A pair of strategies {γ 1∗ ∈
1, γ 2∗ ∈ 2} is in saddle-point equilibrium if the following
set of the inequalities is satisfied ∀γ 1 ∈ 1, γ 2 ∈ 2:
J γ 1∗, γ 2
≤ J γ 1∗, γ 2∗
≤ J γ 1, γ 2∗
(20)
where J(γ 1∗, γ 2∗) is the saddle-point value of the zero-sum
game. To find the saddle-point(s) in a single-act game, we
have to enumerate all the possible outcomes of the game, i.e.,
calculate all the payoffs at the end points of the game tree or
every entry of the game matrix. In all the possible outcomes,
a saddle point (γ 1∗, γ 2∗)k of game Gk has to satisfy (20).
The satisfaction of the condition to be a saddle point can be
expressed in two different ways depending on the given form
of the strategies.
1) Saddle-Point of Pure Strategy: Given a (s × t) matrix
game Gk = {amn}k, ({row m∗, column n∗})k constitutes a
saddle-point equilibrium of pure strategy when the inequality
below is satisfied for all akmn ∈ Gk
k k k
am∗n ≤ am∗n∗ ≤ amn∗
(21)
and akm∗n∗ is the value of the saddle-point. In this case, no
players have the incentive to betray the equilibrium, such that
the game is running stably under the same strategy choices.
2) Saddle-Point of Mixed Strategy: In this case, the strategy
of a player is a probability distribution on its strategy
space. For example, an allowable strategy for the defender
is to choose P11 w.p. y1, P12 w.p. y2, . . . , Ps1 w.p. ys, where
s
P21i=w1.py.i x=1, P1 and likewise, the attacker is allowed to choose
22 w.p. x2, . . . , Ps2 w.p. xs, where is=1 xi = 1. Let
y and x, respectively denote the probability distribution vectors
as y = (y1, . . . , ys) , x = (x1, . . . , xt), and s-dimensional
simplex Y and t-dimensional simplex X, respectively denote
the two players' strategy spaces. Hence, the average value of
the outcome of the game is expressed as
s
t
m=1 n=1
J(y, x)k =
ymakmnxn = y Gkx.
(22)
In a (s × t) matrix game Gk, the defender and attacker try
to minimize and maximize the value of J(y, x), respectively,
by the appropriate choice of the probability distribution vector
y ∈ Y and x ∈ X. In any matrix game, the average security
levels of the players in mixed strategies coincide, that is
VB(Gk) = min max y Gkx = max min y Gkx = VB(Gk) (23)
Y X X Y
2277
(24)
where VB is the average security level of the defender (equivalently
the average upper value of the game) and V is the
B
average security level of the attacker (equivalently the average
lower value of the game). Hence, as for an (m × n)
matrix game, a saddle point of mixed strategy is comprised
the mixed security strategies for both players, in the form
of {γ1∗, γ2∗} = {y∗, x∗} which satisfies (23). Hence, the
mixed-strategy equilibrium is uniquely given by
VB(Gk) = VB(Gk) = VB(Gk).
B. Dynamic Games Between Attacker and Defender
While attacking, the attacker may constantly change the
target sensor for mainly two reasons.
1) The defender may succeed in avoiding the effect of
jamming when it has exactly protected the information
transmission under attack.
2) A static jamming will increase the risk of being detected
and punished.
The defender also has to adjust its defense actions facing
a dynamic attacker. Hence, both the attacker and defender
should adjust their strategies according to the observation of
both players' past choices in different levels. Their behaviors
can be modeled by a multiact zero-sum game.
Let N denote the set of all K-level strategy profiles of the
players. We define A = (K, ( i)i R, (Ui)i N ) as a game in
which, the defender and attacker compete to compromise and
defend the insecure measurements in set N within K levels.
The aims of attacker and defender are to increase and decrease
the change in LMP, respectively. The game is described as
follows.
1) Players Set: R = {1, 2} the defender (the No. 1 player)
and the attacker (the No. 2 player).
2) Strategies: Attacker chooses measurements of a bus to
attack at different levels in order to get the maximum
profit V(A). Defender choose measurements of a bus to
protect at different levels in order to minimize the profit
V(A).
3) Strategy Set i: The set of available strategies for
player i, 1 = {P11, . . . , P1m}, and 2 = {P21, . . . , Pn2},
where m and n are the maximum number of strategies
of all insecure measurements and their profiles that the
attacker and defender can choose from.
4) Utility: U2 = kK=1 hk · Lk((γ 1, γ 2)k) and U1 = −U2
for the attacker and defender, respectively. hk is the profited
electricity amount at level k and Lk(·) is the per
unit price difference at level k.
We assume that the defense and attack process lasts for K
levels. The behaviors of the defender and attacker are modeled
by a multiact discrete-time game tree illustrated in Fig. 2.
A typical strategy profile of a player is composed of K components
as (γ11, . . . , γK1) is for the defender and (γ12, . . . , γK2)
for the attacker, where γi1 ∈ i1 and γj2 ∈ j2 are the strategy
pair at the jth level. We denote the set of all strategies of Si's
at the jth level of play by ji.
1) Properties of the Dynamic Game: Before illustrating the
dynamic game theoretic algorithm, we introduce the properties
of dynamic game solutions, which guarantee the optimality

TABLE II
RECURSIVE ALGORITHM FOR OPTIMIZATION IN MULTIACT GAME

of the outcome assigned by the saddle-point-strategy
profiles.
1) Backward Induction: The algorithm with backward
induction begins with finding the optimal strategies in
the final level K for every possible historical action
branches in level K −1. Then, it backs to level K −1 and
determines the optimal choices in that level. The algorithm
proceeds this operation to the initiate level and
constructs a strategy profile which is a Nash equilibrium.
It guarantees that every player's actions are optimal at
every possible history.
2) Subgame Perfection: A subgame is a subset of a dynamic
game. When the game is carried out in divided time
slots, we need to establish a multiact game model.
A strategy profile of dynamic game is in the subgame
perfect Nash equilibrium, if it constitutes a Nash
equilibrium in each of the subgames.
3) Dynamic Programming: Dynamic programming in multiact
games requires the value reassignment through the
backward induction. The vertexes of all single-act subgames
at current level will be considered as the end
nodes of the previous level. Then, the recursive procedure
is required to simplify the multiact feedback
games from K-level games to (K−1)-level games, and
ultimately the single-act ones with the optimal outcome.
Compared with the repeated game, players in the dynamic
game do not have to keep their stable strategies. With complete
information at the current level and that of all the past
choices, they are able to evaluate every possible outcome combining
the effect of the other player's behavior at the current
stage and try to find an optimal strategy for the current stage.
With the above properties of the dynamic game, both players
can reach the optimal solutions of the dynamic game. The
multiact game is divided by time slots and the decisions made
in different time slots do not interact with each other, so the
payoffs of the attacker at each level will be independently
addictive.
2) Algorithm for the Defense and Attack Game: Next,
we introduce the proposed algorithm for the defense and
attack process to find the equilibrium solution of the multiact
game, as shown in Table II. Based on decomposition
of the multiact game, the algorithm begins with determining
the optimal choices for all sub-game in level K and
operate recursively till the first level is reached, satisfying
the property of backward induction. For every recursion, the
operation of dynamic programming simplifies the game structure.
Step-by-step, the saddle point equilibrium strategy pairs,
{γ11∗, γ12∗},. . . , {γK1∗, γK2∗} at each level can be computed. We
prove that all these pairs constitute a entire Nash equilibrium
strategy profile of the dynamic game. This method provides the
players with a systematic procedure to find the most effective
strategy to maximize their payoffs.
Proposition 1: The saddle-point solutions of the dynamic
game A satisfy recursively the following set of K pairs of
inequalities for all γji ∈ ji, i = 1, 2; j = 1, . . . , K:
J(γ11, . . . , γK1−1γK1∗; γ12, . . . , γK2) ≤ J(γ11, . . . , γK1∗; ⎫

γ12∗, . . . , γK2∗) ≤ J(γ11, γ21∗, . . . , γK1∗; γ12∗, . . . , γK2∗). ⎭⎪⎪
(25)
Proof: According to the specific characteristic of the established
model, the function of the value of outcomes in the
whole game, J(γ11, γ21, . . . , γK1; γ12, γ22, . . . , γK2) is independently
addictive. That is, the value of the multiact game
is added by the value of the every single-act sub-game in
different levels together. It can be described as
J γ11, . . . , γK1−1, γK1; γ12, . . . , γK2−2, γK2−1, γK2
= J γ11, γ12
+ · · · + J γK1, γK2 .
(26)
We denote J(γj1, γj2)i as the ith possible profit the attacker
can gain at level j. Based on the algorithm introduced
before, every saddle-point solution at level j, J(γj1∗, γj2∗)i for
corresponding Gij satisfies the inequality below
J γ11, γ21, . . . , γj1−1, γj1∗

≤ J γ11, γ21, . . . , γj1 i ; γ12, γ22, . . . , γj2−1, γj2∗
i
.

(27)
Then, we minus J(γ11, γ21, . . . , γj1−1; γ 2, γ22, . . . , γj2 ) on
1 −1
both sides of the inequality sign. Together with the additivity,
j
(27) will be altered into the inequality below for all Gi
J γj1∗, γj2 i ≤ J γj1∗, γj2∗ i ≤ J γj1, γj2∗ .
i
As for the final strategy pair at level j, {γj1∗, γj2∗} is the
combination of all (γj1∗, γj2∗)i. Then, it obviously leads to the
conclusion
J γi1∗, γi2
≤ J γi1∗, γi2∗
≤ J γi1, γi2∗ .
Thus, with the same mathematical tricks to add the same
value to the items on both sides of the inequality sign, we can
deduce the set of inequalities (25) by

algorithm. Both players in simply repeated games will repeat
their strategies at the start in the following levels, so they fix
their strategy choice on {γ11∗, γ12∗}. Then, two players' strategy
sequences can be denoted as (γ11∗, . . . , γ11∗; γ12∗, . . . , γ12∗).
The optimality proved in (31) shows that simply repeated cannot
perform as well as the dynamic programming algorithm,

C. Discussions on the Algorithm
In this subsection, we compare the proposed algorithm with
the simply repeated algorithm and discuss the scalability of the
algorithm.
1) Algorithm Comparison: The multiact game can be
solved with different algorithms one of which is the simply
repeated algorithm. Different from the dynamic programming
algorithm, simply repeated games ignore the information evolution,
with mere consideration of the best outcome in the
current level. The players take simply repeated algorithm will
repeat their choices during the whole process without any
strategy evolution based on the observation of the history. In
this case, the maximization will be processed for one time at
the first level, followed with the repetition in the rest levels.
Then, backward induction is not required in simply repeated
is satisfied for all two-person zero-sum dynamic games with
information evolution.
2) Discussion on Scalability: As the proposed algorithm
J γi1∗, γi2∗ . (30) is based on backward induction, it begins with the last level
and has to enumerate all the possible strategy pairs at that
level. Let N1 and N2, respectively denote the number of strategies
held by players 1 and 2, and K denote the level of
dynamic game. The time complexity of the proposed algorithm
is O (N1N2)K+1 . If we assume that the defender can
choose n1 out of m1 buses to defense and the attacker can
attack n2 out of m2 buses, we have N1 = mn11 and N2 = mn22 .
From the above, we can see that the increase of game level
will effectively increase the time complexity as the work of
(31) evaluations has largely increased. As for n1 and n2, we see
that with higher capabilities to attack and defense, the players
will have more possible choices of the strategy combinations,
causing the complexity to increase.
V. NUMERICAL RESULTS
A. Parameters
We analyze the effect of attack on the PJM five-bus test
system in [36] with some slightly modifications. Transmission
lines' parameters are given in Tables III and IV, generators'
and loads' parameters (including Gmax, Ci, and Di) in Fig. 3.
i
The default values of the measurements are shown in Table V.
These default values are utilized to substitute corresponding
insecure measurements, when the real-time measurements
have been jammed. Fig. 4 demonstrates the effect of jamming
attack on the LMPs when the measurement P5 has been
attacked within a 5 min operation. The gross profit for per
unit of electricity gained by the attack L = 25 ($/MWh).

Fig. 4. Comparison of LMPs with and without attack.
If the attacker buys 10 MWh electricity at every bus before
attacking and sells it when successfully jamming, it can gain
$250 in total.
B. Two-Person Zero-Sum Dynamic Games
In the real electricity power systems, we suppose that there
are three insecure measurements {P1, P3, P5}, only one of
which can be compromised by the attacker at each level. Once
the previous transmitted data is jammed, the system will be
aware of it. Different from static games, the attacker and the
defender can adapt their choices with the observation of the
past strategy sequences, but their choices at the current level
will not be aware of by each other.
It is assumed that only when the attacker chooses the same
Pi with the defender, it will not be compromised through jamming;
otherwise, the jamming is successfully achieved with the
change in profit. In Table VI, the change in LMP when the
attacker successfully compromises one of measurements in S
at one level is provided.
TABLE VII
FEEDBACK GAMES IN MATRIX FORM WITH TWO LEVELS
TABLE VIII
VALUES OF J CORRESPONDING TO DEFENDER'S INFORMATION SETS AT
SECOND LEVEL
Here, we assume a two-level attack, in which all values
assigned to terminal nodes in Fig. 1 is provided in Table VII,
in which the possible outcomes are decided by defender's
two choices in order represented in rows and the attacker's
two choices in columns. In each level, the attacker will buy
10 MHw at every bus before attacking and sell the power
when jamming. Then, we will show how the attacker optimizes
its profit in this two-level attack. Obviously, more levels
involved will only require for more steps to repeat the same
optimization procedure in our analysis.
C. Results of Dynamic Recursive Algorithm
Applying the proposed algorithm, we start at the second
level (the last level). The recursive procedure requires
nine single-act saddle-point solutions corresponding to the
defender's nine information sets at this level. The outcomes
belonging to different single-act games is calculated from
Table VII. After the integration of all mixed strategies γˆ21∗
and γˆ22∗ which satisfies (20), we have
⎧ P1, w.p.0.33
γˆ21∗ = ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨⎪ PPPP5351,,,, wwww....pppp....0000....63627289 iiff γγ1111 == γγ1122, γ12 = P1
⎩⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪ PPP515,,, www...ppp...000...637281 iiff γγ1111 == γγ1122,, γγ1122 == PP53,
2
γˆ2 ∗ = P3.
(33)
Then, with the optimal strategy in the second level given,
we can simplify the original game into the single-act one with
its terminal points. Moreover, all values of {J1∗, J2∗, . . . , J9∗} are
shown in Table VIII. Similarly, through the same procedure,
MA et al.: MULTIACT DYNAMIC GAME STRATEGY FOR JAMMING ATTACK IN ELECTRICITY MARKET
2281
Fig. 5. Dynamic optimality between two algorithms.
the saddle-point equilibrium of the first level denoted by
(γ11∗, γ12∗) is calculated as
1
γˆ1 ∗ =
P1, w.p.0.29
P5, w.p.0.71,
2
γˆ1 ∗ = P3.
(34)
Then, we can solve the final value L = 6.36. Thus, the
benefit achieved by the attacker is 10 × 6.36 = $63.6.
To sum-up, the attacker choosing the optimal strategy
{γ11∗, γ21∗; γ12∗, γ22∗} to jam the bus on which the electricity
transmitted will be paid for $6.36 per unit to the attacker.
Finally, the dynamic solution can provide the players with the
information evolution to optimize their strategy with the strategy
selection sequences. Both players can take the advantage
of the information available to maximize their profit and reach
an equilibrium at each level.
We can find that the saddle-point equilibrium at each level
is in the mixed strategy, all of which altogether constitutes
the optimal outcome in the long term. Besides, the dynamic
programming and backward induction are necessary for information
evolution, during which both attacker and defender's
optimal choices at the different levels are not static. We can
see the difference between the dynamic game with multiple
levels and the simple repetitive game, which lies in the availability
to past choices of the other player participating the
game. From the saddle-point solution in the second level, we
can find that their strategies are based on their observation
of the past choice sequences. Every time they decide what to
choose at the beginning of the game at each level, they will
base their choices with the consideration of what the other one
has chosen before.
D. Dynamic Optimality Comparison With Simple
Repeated Algorithm
The players in simple repeated games are unaware of the
past strategy sequences chosen by the other participants in
the game. They repeat their choices constantly at each level,
regardless of what happened in the previous stage. In such
situation, the outcome of the multiact game will be exactly
linear in the amount of the profit paid to the attacker at each
level. Then, we can find that the attacker's profit from two
different algorithms are given in Fig. 5. As for single-act
games, two algorithms will be quite the same with each other.
Obviously, with the number of the game level increasing, the
algorithm involved with the dynamic evolution better improves
the attacker's final outcome.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we introduced the pricing mechanism and
the method attackers utilize to change the congestion and the
electricity price. Then, we formulated the optimization problem
of maximizing attacker's profit from the most effective
strategy choices with the context of the theory about multiact
two-person zero-sum game with the extensive forms. We
constructed the detailed algorithm to solve the problem step
by step and give the further demonstration of its optimality.
In simulation, we gave the specific example of a PJM fivebus
test system, in which we provided the detailed procedure
shown in Table II to find the saddle-point equilibrium of the
game at each level, all of which altogether were combined to
build the final solution in a multiact game.
