Abstract- False data injection attacks have recently been
introduced as an important class of cyber attacks against smart
grid's wide area measurement and monitoring systems. These
attacks aim to compromise the readings of multiple power grid
sensors and phasor measurement units in order to mislead the
operation and control centers. Recent studies have shown that
if an adversary has complete knowledge on the power grid
topology and transmission-line admittance values, he can adjust
the false data injection attack vector such that the attack remains
undetected and successfully passes the residue-based bad data
detection tests that are commonly used in power system state
estimation. However, in this paper, we explain that a realistic
false data injection attack is essentially an attack with incomplete
information due to the attackers lack of real-time knowledge
with respect to various grid parameters and attributes such as
the position of circuit breaker switches and transformer tap
changers and also because of the attacker's limited physical
access to most grid facilities. We mathematically characterize
false data injection attacks with incomplete information from
both the attacker's and grid operator's viewpoints. Furthermore,
we introduce a novel vulnerability measure that can compare and
rank different power grid topologies against such attacks. To the
best of our knowledge, this paper is the first study to investigate
false data injection attacks with line admittance uncertainty.

I. INTRODUCTION
The recent advancements in smart grid control and monitoring
systems, such as two-way communication capabilities and
distributed intelligence, can significantly enhance efficiency
and reliability [1]. However, they may also create new vulnerabilities
in power infrastructures if they are not accompanied
with appropriate security enforcements. In particular, it has
recently been shown that cyber attacks against the wide area
measurement and supervisory control and data acquisition
systems have the potential to significantly damage the power
grid and the utilities and consumer equipment [2].
A new and important class of cyber attacks against smart
grid's wide area measurement systems is recently identified
in [3] as false data injection attacks (FDIAs). In FDIA an
adversary aims to hack the readings of multiple sensors and
phasor measurement units (PMUs) to mislead smart grid's
decision making process. In [3] showed that if the false data
injection vector fulfils certain conditions, the adversary will be
able to inject an arbitrary amount of error in state estimation
and yet the FDIA will still successfully pass the commonly
used residue-based bad data detection tests in power system
state estimation [4]. The later studies further revealed that an
adversary may even gain some economic advantages by using
FDIA against the wholesale electricity market [5].
In [6], the authors showed that one can prevent a false data
injection attack against state estimation by protecting a subset
of sensors and PMUs. However, the number of sensors that
need to be protected can be large, e.g., as many as one third
of all sensors connected to the grid buses [7]. Another thread
of research seeks to improve the existing residue-based bad
data detection methods in state estimation such that they can
also detect false data injection attacks. For example, the use
of L∞-norm versus L2-norm detectors are investigated in [8].
The more advanced generalized likelihood ratio test and the
adaptive cumulative sum control chart test are also recently
proposed to detect FDIAs in [9] and [10], respectively.
A common assumption in most prior work on FDIAs, e.g.,
in [3], [5]-[10], is that the attacker has complete knowledge
about the power grid topology and transmission-line
admittances. In fact, such information is implicitly assumed
available to the attacker in order to construct the false data
injection attack vector. However, an important practical scenario
is the case when the attacker has limited information with
respect to the power network topology or admittance for some
transmission-lines. Therefore, the focus of this paper is to take
the first step to investigate the possibilities for implementing a
successful false data injection attack with limited information.
The contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows.
• We explain that a realistic FDIA is essentially an attack
with incomplete information due to the attacker's lack of
real-time knowledge with respect to the status of various
grid elements such as the position of circuit breaker
switches and transformer tap changers and also because
of his/her limited physical access to most grid facilities.
• We mathematically characterize FDIAs with limited information
and show how the impact of the attack on the
power grid as well as the likelihood of the attack being
detected can be affected by the attacker's lack of complete
knowledge about the grid parameters and attributes.
• We study FDIAs with limited information from both
attacker's as well as grid operator's viewpoints. From an
attacker's point of view, depending on the uncertainty
patterns, we distinguish perfect and imperfect attacks.
From an operator's point of view, we introduce a novel

3153
vulnerability measure that can compare and rank various
power grid topologies. This can potentially help building
power grids that are less vulnerable against FDIAs.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The system
model and the background on FDIAs with limited information
are given in Section II. We mathematically characterize FDIAs
with limited information in Section III. Optimizing such attacks
from the attacker's viewpoint is discussed in Section IV.
Analyzing the grid vulnerability from the operator's viewpoint
are investigated in Section V. Simulation results are presented
in Section VI. The paper is concluded in Section VII.
II. SYSTEM MODEL AND BACKGROUND
A. State Estimation in Power Systems
Let z denote an m×1 vector of all measurements in a power
system such as power flows at transmission lines and power
injections and loads at buses. The power flow measurements
can be taken at one or both ends of a transmission line. In the
state estimation problem in power systems, we are interested in
using the collected set of measurements to estimate an n × 1
vector of unknown states x, where n m. The unknown
states can be, for example, the voltage angles at different buses.
Let H denote the m × n network topology matrix. We have
z = Hx + e,
(4)
(5)
(6)
za = z+a, where a is an m×1 false data vector. Clearly, given
the false measurement vector za, the state estimation solution
becomes xˆa = xˆ. As shown in [3], false data injection can
sometimes be detected by using bad data detection methods
which evaluate the measurement residue:
za − Hxˆa,
and trigger an alarm if the residue becomes greater than a
preset limit. However, the results in [3] also show that if the
attacker selects the false data injection vector a to be a linear
combination of the rows in matrix H, i.e., a = Hc for some
arbitrary n × 1 vector c, then the bad data detection methods
based on residue test will not be able to detect the attack since
the injected false data will no longer affect the residue:
za − Hxˆa = z + a − H(xˆ + c) = z − Hxˆ,
where
where e denotes measurement noise. In general, there are three
criteria that are commonly used to estimate the system states:
maximum likelihood, weighted least-square, and minimum
variance. When the measurement noise is Gaussian with zero
mean, these criteria lead to the same estimator [4]:
xˆ = (HT WH)−1HT Wz,
where the m × m noise co-variance matrix W is diagonal.
Next, we explain how the network topology matrix H is
constructed. Let A denote the l × n grid connectivity matrix,
where l denotes the number of transmission lines. Without
loss of generality we assume an arbitrary direction for each
transmission line. For each transmission line i, the element in
ith row and jth column is Aij = 1, if the direction of link i
is from bus j, Aij = −1, if the direction of link i is towards
bus j, and Aij = 0, otherwise. Note that the power flow on a
transmission line is assumed positive if it is at the direction of
the line and negative if it is at the opposite of the direction of
the line. Let D denote an l × l diagonal matrix representing
the admittance of all transmission lines. For the rest of this
paper, we assume that the collected measurements for state
estimation comprise of all bus injections and power flows at
both directions of all buses. Therefore, we have [11]:
H = ⎣
⎡ AT DA⎤
DA
−DA
⎦ .
B. False Data Injection Attack with Complete Information
In False Data Injection Attack against smart grid, an adversary
aims to hack the readings of sensors such that the
vector of measurement z is replaced by a compromised vector
(1)
(2)
(3)
3154
xˆa = xˆ + (HT WH)−1HT WHc = xˆ + c.
In other words, if the attacker has complete knowledge of the
grid topology and line admittances such that he can accurately
construct matrix H, then he will be able to implement a false
data injection attack which is not detected by a residue test,
yet it is able to inject an arbitrary error to the state estimation
solution. However, we believe that in practice, the attacker's
knowledge can be limited and involve uncertainties.
C. Obtaining Grid Connectivity and Admittance Matrices
As explained in Section II-B, to implement a false data
injection attack, an adversary needs to construct matrix H.
From (3), this requires knowledge on connectivity matrix A
and admittance matrix D. Such knowledge can be gained
through both offline and online data collections. Offline data
collection can be done weeks, months, or even years before
implementing the actual attack and may involve getting access
to the grid topology maps through intruders or former utility
company employees. However, offline data collection may not
be enough to implement an attack. On one hand, some offline
data could be outdated due to new construction and expansion
of the existing transmission lines. On the other hand, in most
practical cases, the exact position of circuit breaker switches,
transformer tap changers, etc. can significantly affect the
connectivity and admittance matrices, and thus the true value
of matrix H. Therefore, an adversary may need to implement
some online data collection efforts, e.g., by deploying its own
sensors and PMUs. Nevertheless, due to limited resources and
restricted physical access to the grid, online data collection
may not be feasible and the attack may essentially become
an attack with incomplete information. Investigating this realistic
scenario is the focus of this paper. In particular, we
are interested in the case where the adversary has limited
information of the line admittance values. This can be due
to various practical reasons as we explain next.
First, the position of the transformer tap changers across the
power grid may sometimes change to adjust the voltage and
current ratios based on the power system operation conditions.
An example is shown in Fig. 1. In this figure, the transmission

line between bus 1 and bus 2 includes fixed admittance values
X1 and X2 and a transformer with turns ratio 1 : a. In this
case, the total admittance for the transmission lines between
the two buses is a2X1 + X2 for the right side. Clearly, while
offline data collection can be used to obtain X1 and X2, the
exact position of the tap changer, i.e., the value of parameter a
may only be obtained via online data collection and/or physical
access to the transformer site. If such access is not feasible, the
uncertainty with respect to parameter a will affect constructing
matrix D and thus H. Second, even for transmission lines
without transfer, obtaining the line admittance may require
knowledge of the exact length of the transmission line and type
of the conductor being used. Finally, even if the adversary can
measure line admittance in an offline effort, the values may
change by the time of implementing the attack due to weather
conditions and changes in temperature [12].
III. FALSE DATA INJECTION ATTACKS
WITH INCOMPLETE INFORMATION
Consider a false data injection attack with incomplete information
where the attacker does not have accurate knowledge
about matrix H, e.g., because of the issues discussed in Section
II-C. Let us denote the attacker's understanding of the topology
matrix H as H¯ = H + δ, where δ is an m × n error matrix.
Therefore, the false data injection attack vector implemented
by the attacker in this case will be in the following form:
a = H¯ c = (H + δ) c = Hc + δc.
(7)
Of course, since a = Hc, most existing theorems on FDIAs,
e.g., those in [3], [5], are no longer applicable and the attack is
no longer guaranteed to pass the residue test in Section II-B.
In other words, the adversary's limited information may cause
the attack to be detected by the grid operator.
From [3], vector c in (7) is the estimation error that the
attacker intends to inject into the state estimation solution.
Similarly, let c¯ denote the estimation error that the attacker
actually injects into the solution in case of an attack with
incomplete information. Note that, in general, c¯ = c. The
state estimation solution under attack is obtained as,
xˆa = (HT WH)−1HT W za
= (HT WH)−1HT W(z + a)
= (HT WH)−1HT W(z + Hc + δc)
= xˆ + c + (HT WH)−1HT Wδc.
By definition, we have
From (8) and (9), we can conclude that
xˆa = xˆ + c¯.
c¯ = c + (HT WH)−1HT Wδc.
where
ra = za − Hxˆa
= z + a − H(xˆ + c¯)
= r + δc + H(c − c¯)
= r + (I − Γ)δc,
Γ
H(HT WH)−1HT W.
Note that Γ is a fixed m × m matrix which only depends
on the matrixes H and W. In presence of no false data
injection attack, i.e., when a = 0, bad data detection works
by evaluating the following residue-related inequality test [4]:
where C is a control parameter that is selected based on the
choice of false alarm rate. We also have
J (xˆ) ≤ C,

Similarly, for the case of a false data injection attack with

Together, (10) and (15) characterize an FDIA false data
injection attack with incomplete information. Note that, for an
attack with complete information, where δ = 0, from (10) and
(15), we have c¯ = c and J (xˆa) = J (xˆ). Furthermore, we can
see that the amount of injected estimation error in (10) and the
residue test outcome in (15) depend on not only the attacker's
modeling error δ but also some grid-specific parameters, i.e.,
matrixes H and W. Of course, neither the attacker nor the grid
operator are aware of the exact value of attacker's modeling
error matrix δ. However, while the attacker does not have an
accurate knowledge of H, W, and Γ, these matrices are indeed
known to the power grid operator. Therefore, we investigate
the false data injection attacks with limited information first
from the attacker's viewpoint and then from the grid operator's
viewpoint.
IV. ATTACKER'S VIEW POINT
In this section, we will discuss what an attacker can achieve
when he has limited information. From (10) and (15) we
can distinguish two different scenarios: a) Perfect Attacks: the
attacks that can assure achieving δc = 0 even though δ = 0;
b) Imperfect Attacks: the attacks that cannot assure achieving
δc = 0. Next, we characterize perfect and imperfect attacks.
then achieving δ c = 0 is guaranteed regardless of the values
of the admittances for the rest of the grid transmission lines.
Proof : First, we note that by definition, the summation of
all entries in each row of the connectivity matrix A is zero.
That is, for each row i = 1, . . . , l, we always have
n
j=1
Aij = 0.
Let denote the diagonal matrix of errors in the attacker's
knowledge on the lines admittance values. From (3), we have
H + δ = ⎣
⎡ AT (D + )A⎤
(D + )A ⎦
−(D + )A
⇒
δ = ⎣
⎡ AT A⎤
A ⎦ . (19)
− A
Thus, a sufficient condition to have δ c = 0 is to have
Ac = 0.
Consider an arbitrary cut for the power network topology and
the two constructed disjoint islands of buses N1 and N2, as
defined in Theorem 1. Next, we reorder the rows of matrix
A such that the first rows correspond to the links in the
first island, denoted by [A1 0], then it comes to the rows
corresponding to the links that belong to the cut, denoted by
Ac, and finally it comes to the tows corresponding to the links
in the second island, denoted by [0 A2]. That is,
A = ⎣
⎡ A1
0
Ac
0 ⎤
A2
⎦ .
If the attacker knows the admittance values for all the
transmission lines on the cut, then we have
⎡ 1

A. Perfect Attacks with Limited Information
A perfect attack is a false data injection attack in which
δc = 0 and consequently c¯ = c and J (xˆa) = J (xˆ). A
perfect FDIA cannot be detected by a residue test, regardless
of the fact that the attacker's knowledge about matrix H is not
accurate. The following definition and theorem explain how we
can characterize perfect FDIAs under attacks with incomplete
information and transmission-line admittance uncertainties.
Definition: A cut is a set of transmission lines in a grid
that can divide the power network into two disjoint islands. In
general, each power grid topology may have several cuts.
Theorem 1: We can show that a) An attacker can implement
a perfect FDIA under transmission-line admittance uncertainties
if it has complete knowledge about the admittance values
of all transmission lines on at least one cut. b) Let N1 and
N2 denote the set of buses in the two disjoint islands that are
formed by the aforementioned cut, if the attacker selects
ci = cj
ci = cj
∀ i, j ∈ N1,
∀ i, j ∈ N2,
where 1 and 2 are diagonal. From (18) and (22), condition
(20) holds if vector c is selected as in (16) and (17).
From Theorem 1, knowing the admittance values for all
transmission lines in the power grid is not necessary for implementing
a perfect FDIA with limited information. Instead,
the attacker only needs to know the admittance values for only
a small group of transmission lines that together can form a
cut. That is, having limited information on other transmission
lines does not affect the attacker's ability in implementing a
successful and effective FDIA. Of course, the attack would
still face some limitations in terms of the injected estimation
errors into the state estimation solution as such errors cannot
be arbitrary and need to follow the conditions in (16) and (17).
B. Imperfect Attacks with Limited Information
Next, assume that the attacker does not have exact knowledge
about the transmission line admittance values for any cut
in the power grid topology. In that case, reaching δc = 0, i.e.,
implementing a perfect attack, may not be possible. Instead,
the attacker may only have some probability distribution of the
transmission line admittance values. Such information can be
obtained from offline data collection, e.g., the historical data
of the position of each transformer's tap changer, etc.
From (10) and (15), the attacker should seek to simultaneously
minimize (HT WH)−1HT Wδc to achieve c¯ ≈ c
and minimize √W(I − Γ)δc to achieve J (xˆa) ≈ J (xˆ).
However, these objectives can be reached only if the attacker
is accurately aware of matrixes H, W, and Γ, which is not
the case in an attack with limited information. Therefore, an
attacker may have no choice but using some offline knowledge
on the probability distribution of the elements of matrix δ as
mentioned earlier and rather focus on minimizing ||δc||. In
this regard, the adversary may aim to select vector c such that
it can solve the following stochastic optimization problem:
maxicmize mini ∈imNum ci
subject to E { δ c } ≤ κ√C
(23)
Here, the objective is to maximize the impact of the attack
by maximizing the minimum amount of error to be injected
into the state estimation solutions. However, in order to limit
the chance of the attack being detected, the solution should be
subject to maintaining the expected norm of δc below κ√C,
where 0 < κ < 1 is an attack planning parameter. We note
that if a perfect attack is feasible, then the optimal solution of
problem (23) will automatically become as in (16) and (17)
and the optimal objective value will be unbounded regardless
of the probability distribution of the unknown transmission
line admittance values. Furthermore, we note that one can
introduce an auxiliary variable t and replace problem (23) with
the following equivalent optimization problem:
maximize t
c,t
subject to E { δ c } ≤ κ√C
ci ≥ t,
∀ i ∈ N .
(24)
Problem (24) is a standard stochastic convex program that can
be solved, e.g., using scenario generation as explained in [13].

grid on the left is more vulnerable against FDIAs with incomplete information.
V. GRID OPERATOR'S VIEW POINT
Similar to the attacker, the grid operator is not aware of
the attacker's modeling mismatch matrix δ. However, unlike
the attacker, the grid operator does know the true and up-todate
values of matrices H, W, and Γ. Given such knowledge,
the grid operator is interested in answering the following two
questions: 1) Which power grid topologies, characterized by
matrices H, W, and Γ, are less vulnerable against FDIAs
with incomplete information. 2) Can we slightly change a
power grid topology and
make it less vulnerable against
FDIAs with incomplete information. For example, consider
the two partly similar power grid topologies in Fig. 2. From
[3], if the attacker has complete knowledge about matrix H
corresponding to each of these two topologies, then the two
networks are equally vulnerable to a FDIA as long as the
adversary selects the attack vector as a = Hc as discussed in
Section II-B. However, as shown next, one can argue that in
case of FDIAs with incomplete information, the power grid in
Fig. 2(b) is less vulnerable compared to the grid in Fig 2(a).
To obtain an analytical measure for vulnerability against
FDIAs with limited information, we note that an attack is
successful if it is likely to pass the bad data detection test
in (15) while it imposes a significant error in power state
estimation solution. Thus, given H, W, and Γ for each grid
topology and given a probability distribution function for
mismatch matrix δ, we can introduce a vulnerability measure
(VM) specific to the power grid topology of interest as follows:
V M =
maximum t
c,t
subject to E
√
W(I − Γ)δ c
≤
√
C
(25)
ci ≥ t,
∀ i ∈ N .
We may note the following remarks. First, the difference
between problems (24) and (25) is in the choice of constraints.
mismatch variance increases. Finally, the VM in (24) can be
used to compare the vulnerability of different power grids with
similar probability distribution functions for mismatch matrix
δ. As we will explain in detail in Section VI for the case of
topologies in Fig. 2, some power grid topologies can be seen
to less vulnerable to FDIAs with incomplete information.
VI. SIMULATION RESULTS
In this section, we assess the efficiency of FDIAs with
incomplete information. First, the results on detecting an
imperfect FDIA in an IEEE 118 bus test system are shown
in Fig. 3. Here, we have plotted the measurement residue
under the attack versus 1000 different measurement noise
scenarios. The residue test parameter C is set at such a value
that 2.5% residue goes up it without attack. We can see
that the rate of detecting the attack with the residue test is
as low as only 3.5%, which is minor indicating that having
incomplete information has not affected the attacker's ability
in implementing a successful FDIA attack significantly.

In (24), the grid operator obtains an estimate on how strong
stronger attacks, i.e., attacks with higher values for the entries
an attack can become while it is not detected, in a stochastic
of vector c. However, higher κ will increase the risk of the
sense, by a bad data detection test. Second, For each topology,

for matrix δ. Assuming a Gaussian distribution with zero
mean for each element of matrix δ, one can expect that the

to 10%, then the probability of detecting the imperfect FDIAs
VM decreases, i.e., the grid becomes less vulnerable, as the
with limited information on transmission line admittance is

as small as only 5%. As we increase κ, although the attacks
become stronger, the probability of detecting the attacks will
increase. Note that, these results are for the cases where the
attack is imperfect. Clearly, if the attack is perfect or the
attacker has complete information, then the attack strength
can arbitrarily increase without affecting the measurement
residues, as long as vector c is selected according to the
conditions in (16) and (17) as explained in Theorem 1.
Next, we simulate 20 different attack scenarios under different
topologies and different transmission line admittance
uncertainties. The results are shown in Fig. 5. In each case,
the attack vector a is calculated based on (7) where c
is chosen according to the solution of problem (24). The
probability distribution of the unknown admittance parameters
are assumed to be normal and spanned within
the correct admittance values. We can see that except for
scenario 14, the probability of detecting the attack is small
and below 10%. On the other hand, in almost all cases
the FDIA under uncertainties have significant strengths. For
example, in scenario 6, while the minimum injected error in
state estimation (i.e., the attack strength) is around 135%, the
probability of attack being detected is only 4%. The trade-off
between the attack strength and the probability of detecting
the attack depends on the configuration of the transmission
line admittance uncertainties as explained in Theorem 1.
Finally, we compare the vulnerability measures of the
two topologies in Fig. 2. For each topology, we plot the
vulnerability measure, as defined in (25), versus the variance
±20% of
in the attacker's modeling error δ. Recall that the vulnerability
measure is calculated by the grid operator to assess how
vulnerable a topology can become given different uncertainty
levels in the attacker's knowledge of the grid. We can see in
Fig. 6 that, for all variance levels, the grid in Fig. 2(b) has
a lower vulnerability measure than the one in Fig. 2(a). This
suggest that the topology in Fig. 2(b) is less vulnerable to
FDIAs with limited information. It is worth mentioning that
if the variance is zero, i.e., in case of an attack with complete
information, then the two topologies are equally vulnerable to
an FDIA as long as the adversary selects the attack vector as
a = Hc as explained in Section II-B.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
We addressed the problem of implementing an FDIA when
the attacker has incomplete information about the admittances
of transmission lines. Such attacks were investigated from both
attacker's and grid operator's viewpoints. We introduced two
types of attacks. First, perfect attacks, where the attacker has
complete knowledge of the admittance for all lines on at least
one cut on the grid topology. Second, imperfect attacks, where
such information is not available. We showed that an attacker
may construct a probability distribution function for each
unknown admittance to design an imperfect attack according
to the solution of a stochastic optimization problem. We also
introduced a novel vulnerability
measure to compare and
rank different grid topologies against FDIAs with incomplete
information. This measure can potentially help building power
grids that are less vulnerable against practical false data
injection attacks when the attacker has limited information.
