Abstract-Dynamic state estimation in power systems plays a central
role in controlling the system operations. State estimation, however, is
vulnerable to malicious cyber attacks that contaminate the controller's
observation through injecting false data into the system. It is, therefore, of
paramount significance not only to detect the attacks, but also to recover
the system state from the contaminated observation when an attack is
deemed to be present. This paper offers a distributed framework for an
optimal such joint attack detection and system recovery. This framework
has two main features: 1) it provides the network operator with the
freedom of striking any desired balance between attack detection and
state recovery accuracies, and 2) it is distributed in the sense that different
controlling agents distributed across the network carry out the attack
detection and system recovery tasks through iterative local processing
and message passing.
I. INTRODUCTION
A. Background
State estimation in electricity grids was initially developed as a
data processing algorithm for converting redundant meter readings,
and possibly other available information, into an estimate of the state
of the grid [1]. The state typically refers to bus voltage magnitudes
and phase angles, and state estimation is a key function to build a
real-time network model in the energy management system (EMS)
[2], [3]. The main task of the traditional state estimators is conducted
centrally in a control center with the following three functions [4]:
Observability analysis: To determine whether a unique estimate
can be found for the system state. This is generally performed
prior to state estimation.
State estimation: To determine the optimal estimate for the
complex voltages at each bus based on real-time analog measurements.
Bad data processing: To detect measurement errors, and identify
and eliminate them if possible.
Conventional bad data detection techniques often determine gross
measurement errors based on the measurement residuals [4]. While
relatively effective against random noises, these conventional detectors
lack the ability to detect highly structured bad data that
conforms to the network topology and physical laws. This raises
serious security concerns about intentional coordinated attacks that
can tamper with the measurements without being detected. In [5]
false data injection attacks against power grid state estimation were
introduced. By leveraging the knowledge of the power network
topology, it was shown that well-designed injected false data could
bypass bad data detectors in today's control systems and become
unobservable by the controllers. In [6] two possible approaches were
proposed that aim at quantifying the effort that the attackers require
for implementing this class of attacks. In [7] and [8] efforts have
been made to develop computationally efficient algorithms to detect
small but highly damaging structured attacks against state estimation.
This research was supported in part by the Air Force Office of Scientific
Research under MURI Grant FA9550-09-1-0643 and in part by DTRA under
Grant HDTRA-1-07-1-0037.
Besides the challenges related to unobservable attacks, electricity
industry deregulation has led to the creation of many regional
transmission organizations (RTOs) within a large interconnected
power system [2]. Hence, a substantially larger number of smart
elements are appearing in the grid such that the grid requires
significantly more computational, processing, and communication
resources. As such, both technical and institutional drivers suggest
the need for more distributed information processing and control
in power system operations [9]. For this purpose, distributed state
estimation methods have been considered for decades with the initial
goal of reducing the computational burden at the central control
via distributing the centralized task across the system. A simple but
effective approach is decomposition-and-merge, which is essentially
a two-level hierarchical method [10], [11]. At the lower level, each
local area independently runs its own estimator based on its local
measurements, while at the higher level, the central coordinator
receives the state estimation results, with boundary measurements if
necessary, from the individual areas and then combines them to obtain
a system-wide solution. The star-like hierarchical methods are also
discussed in recent literature such as [12] and [13]. More recently,
a hybrid distributed state estimation using the synchronized phasor
measurements as well as the conventional measurements has been
proposed [14], [15], [16].
While there exists a rich literature on state estimation as well as
on attack detection, the interplay between these two closely-related
problems has not been addressed yet; the analysis of this interplay
is the purpose of this paper. We also address the considerations
and limitations of distributed processing by introducing a distributed
procedure that consists of iterative local processing combined with
message passing and aims to achieve network-wide optimal attack
detection and state estimation.
B. Notation
We denote the k-dimensional Euclidean space by Rk. The operator
∥ ∥ denotes the standard Euclidean 2-norm when applied to vectors
and denotes the induced 2-norm when applied to matrices, which
in the latter case is equivalent to the matrix spectral radius for
symmetric matrices. P( ) and E( ) denote probability and expected
value, respectively.
We recall some notation from graph theory [17] to be used in
the description of the distributed algorithms in Section V. The
communication among the RTOs (also referred to as subsystems or
agents or nodes) will be modeled by an undirected graph G = (V; E),
in which V = [1; ; N ] denotes the set of nodes with cardinality
jV j = N , and E is the set of edges with cardinality jEj = M . The
unordered pair (n; l) belongs to E if there exists an edge between
nodes n 2 V and l 2 V . We consider only simple graphs, i.e., graphs
devoid of self-loops and multiple edges. A graph is connected if there

exists a path1, between each pair of nodes. 8n 2 f1; : : : ; N g the
neighborhood of node n is defined as
Ωn =△ fl 2 V j (n; l) 2 Eg :
Throughout the paper, we assume that all the random objects are defined
on a common measurable space. Also, all inequalities involving
random variables are to be interpreted almost surely (a.s.).
II. MALICIOUS DATA INJECTION MODEL
Assuming linearized system dynamics, a general false data injection
attack is modeled as [5]:
Y = HX + Z + B ;
(1)
(2)
where Y is the observation vector, X represents the power system
state vector, and the matrix H denotes the Jacobian matrix that
models the linearized dynamics at some operating point. Also Z
and B account for the observation noise and the false data injected
by the attacker, respectively. The attack could be launched by one
single autonomous attacker, or by a group of coordinated attackers
that inject the false data based on their collective information about
the network. From the attacker's point of view, the design of the
optimal2 B depends on
1) the extent of the topology and system instantaneous state
(abstracted in the Jacobian H) known to the attackers; and
2) the placement of secure sensors, which are the ones with
sufficient protection that cannot be manipulated [18].
For setting up the attack detection/estimation problem from the
network operator's viewpoint, we assume that in the general situation,
the network operator has no knowledge about the attacker's strategy,
which is a function of the network topology information available
to the attacker. Also, for definiteness, we assume that the system
topology and dynamics H are fully and instantaneously known to
the network operator.
III. INFORMATION CONSTRAINTS OF THE ATTACKER
The effectiveness of an attack depends heavily on how informed
the attacker is about the network dynamics. We indeed assume
that the attacker always selects the best attack strategy based on
their information. Due to security constraints, some critical sensors
of the network cannot be compromised and the attacker has (or
the coordinated attackers collectively have) only partial information
of H. Moreover, even the elements of H corresponding to the
unsecured sensors might not be perfectly known to the attacker
and only noisy estimates of are available to the attacker. Such lack
of perfect knowledge is due to the unpredictable fluctuations in
the system load and the generated power. The attacker, however,
can potentially collect some side statistical information about the
unsecured elements of H by observing and accumulating the system
fluctuations pattern over time.
In order to account for the above two sources of uncertainty
about H (estimation inaccuracy and secure nodes) the instantaneous
Jacobian matrix can be decomposed as
H = H + ∆H1 + ∆H2 ;
(3)
1A path between nodes n and l of length m is a sequence (i0 =
n; i1; ; im = l) of vertices, such that, 8k 2 f0; : : : ; m 1g :
(ik; ik+1) 2 E.
2The term optimal from the attacker's viewpoint refers to the best possible
attack strategy that maximizes a relevant metric, say the probability of attack
detection error.
203
where H denotes the part of H fully known to the attacker, and
∆H1 and ∆H2 represent the unknown instantaneous fluctuations.
∆H1 captures the part of H that is not known to the attacker
instantaneously, but for which the statistics of its fluctuations over
time are known. Finally, ∆H2 models the part of the fluctuations
that, due to the protections in the system, are neither instantly nor
statistically known to the attacker. Therefore, we assume that while
the network operator has access to the entire H, the attacker has
access to H and ∆H1 only.
The attacker aims to design an attack strategy ϕ based on its
knowledge of H. In general, an attack strategy ϕ may be viewed
as a measurable function, mapping H and ∆H1 to the attack vector
as B = ϕ(H; ∆H1). Further, such an attack function is constrained
by the fact some sensors are secured and cannot be compromised,
i.e., ϕ(H; ∆H1) may not influence all the sensor measurements.
By taking into account that the attack strategy ϕ is not known to the
network operator and also by invoking the randomness of ∆H1, the
attack vector is clearly a random vector from the viewpoint of the
network operator. We denote the probability density function of the
attack vector by ϕ(B), which is a function of the attack strategy ϕ.
Under the circumstances that the attacker has full knowledge of H,
the attacker can become undetectable if it aligns its injections within
the range space of H [5]. With partial knowledge of H, however,
the attacker is not guaranteed to align its injections within the range
space of H and, in fact, it leaves a non-zero projection in the kernel
of H almost surely. Motivated by this premise, the best strategy of
the attacker is formalized in the following theorem. The underlying
justification for the best strategy relates to the fact that the attacker
tries to maximize the likelihood that its energy is more focused in
the range space of H rather than its null space.
Theorem 1: Among all attack vectors with a given energy EB ,
i.e., ∥B∥22 = EB , the one with the smallest projection in the null
space of H belongs to the range space of H + ∆H1, i.e.,
arg
min
B: ∥B∥22=EB
E∆H2 [∥B∥2] 2
range (H + ∆H1) :
(4)
Given the direction of the attack vector (from the theorem above),
the attack vector B can be decomposed as
B = (H + ∆H1)B~ ;
(5)
(6)
based on which (2) becomes
Y = H(X + B~ ) + Z
∆H2B~ :
Therefore, the residual of B in the kernel of H, which is determined
by ∆H2B~ , can be reliably detected and estimated based on the combined
detection and estimation framework developed in Section IV.
When certain conditions are satisfied this reliable estimate of B~ can
lead to a reliable estimate of the attack vector B.
IV. CENTRALIZED JOINT ATTACK DETECTION AND INJECTION
ESTIMATION
In this section we consider the hypothetical scenario in which the
power system has a central controller with a global and instantaneous
access to all the network topology abstracted in H. We solve the
attack detection and system recovery problem in this setting, which in
turn provides an upper bound on the performance to be expected from
a system with a set of non-fully coordinated controllers distributed
across the network. In the next section we offer a distributed
procedure for implementing the optimal detectors and estimators that
are presented in this section.
A. Sufficient Statistics
The objective of the defender (system operator) is to simultaneously
detect an injection attack and recover the estimate of the system
state from the attack-contaminated observations. The latter could be
carried out through estimating the attack vector B and eliminating
it from the observation vector Y . The problem of joint detection
and estimation is challenging, and we present general strategies in
the subsequent subsections with various claims of optimality (from
a defender's viewpoint).
In this subsection, we present a theoretical understanding of the
delectability of B. Also, we will see that not all components of
the observation vector Y contain meaningful information about the
attack vector B. As a result, we will seek to identify the portion
of Y that contains all information about B. In statistical language,
such a portion (or functional) of Y containing the attack information
is referred to as a sufficient statistic for the detection-estimation
problem, and, is, in fact, the only part of Y meaningful to a decision
making process.
The difficulty in detection and estimation tasks mainly stems from
the fact that the system state X is unknown to the network operator
(and in fact is sought to be estimated). This, in turn, could be
exploited by a smart attacker, who injects the data into the subspace
spanned by the column vectors of H, making the attack vector B
indistinguishable from the state X. In other words, by defining yy,
by, and zy as the projections of Y , B and Z, respectively, on the
subspace spanned by H, we find that yy given by
yy = HX + by + zy ;
does not leave a detectable trace of the attack as yy carries information
only about the superposition HX + by. More specifically,
X being unknown to the network operator makes recovering by and
X from the superposition HX + by impossible. Hence, all the data
about B will be embedded in its projection on the null space (kernel)
of the matrix H. The projection of the observation vector Y on the
null space of H is given by
y = b + z ;
where b and z are the projections of the vectors B and Z,
respectively, on the null space of H.
Remark 1: Given that the network operator has full knowledge of
the network instantiation, by using the knowledge of H and ∆H2 it
can recover B~ defined in (5) from the estimate on b. Feasibility of this
procedure is mainly governed by whether the linear transformation
of B to B~ and then to b is reversible. The feasibility problem
of interest can be abstracted as analyzing and ensuring the nonsingularity
conditions of the pseudo-inverses of the matrices involved
in the transforming B to b. One approach for ensuring such nonsingularity
is the method developed in [18], which secures some
sensors in the network. The data of the secured sensors is neither
revealed to nor compromised by the attacker. Implementing such
secure sensors provides certain structures for ∆H2 that guarantee
the inverse transformation of interest is non-singular, which in turn
ensures that B can be recovered from b uniquely.
Remark 2: Given the attack-contaminated observation Y , after
estimating B, the network operator (controller) can obtain the attackfree
observations Y~ =△ Y B by subtracting the attack vector B
from the observation Y . Given the reliable attack-free observations
Y~ , the controller can employ a wide range of estimators (e.g., the
minimum mean-square error estimator) to recover the state vector X
from Y B.
B. Joint Detection and Estimation
Upon obtaining y as the projection of the observation vector onto
the null space of H, the objective is to detect the presence of an attack
and simultaneously estimate the injected false data, when an attack
is deemed to be present. This combined detection and estimation
problem can be posed as the following composite binary hypothesis
testing problem with H0 reflecting the no attack hypothesis and H1
representing the attack hypothesis.
H0 :
H1 :
y
y
f0(y)
f1(y j b);
and
b
(b) ;
(9)
where f0(y), f1(y j b), and (b) are known probability density
functions (pdfs). In particular, we assume that under H0 (ie., no
attack, or b = 0), the distribution of y, which inherits all its
randomness from the random noise, is fully known. It is noteworthy
that the system model in (2) and the pertinent analysis provided in the
next sections hold for any noise model, including the Gaussian model.
Also, under H1 (i.e., an attack exists, or b ̸= 0), the distribution of
y depends on the unknown attack vector b, for which we know a
prior distribution (b) based on the attack patterns accumulated over
time. We seek to devise a mechanism that distinguishes between H0
and H1 reliably, and furthermore, whenever it decides in favor of H1
provides an accurate estimate for b.
There are two general approaches in the literature for treating
combined estimation and detection problems. In one direction, the
combined problem is decomposed into two subproblems and each
treated optimally. For instance one can use the Neyman-Pearson
optimum test for detection and the optimum Bayesian estimator for
parameter estimation to solve the two subproblems. Treating each
subproblem independently does not necessarily yield the optimum
overall performance. The second methodology employs the generalized
likelihood ratio test (GLRT) which performs detection and
estimation at the same time. Neither approach is capable of emphasizing
each subproblem according to the needs of the corresponding
application.
Here we formulate the combined problem in a more natural way for
the problem in hand. In particular, when an attack occurs in the power
network, the ultimate objective of the network operator is beyond a
reliable detection of the attack. In fact, detecting the attack will be
used as an intermediate step towards obtaining a reliable estimate
about the injected false data, which in turn facilitates eliminating the
disruptive effects of the false data. Serving this purpose necessitates
that the operator obtain the best estimate about the false data injected.
Therefore, assuring good estimation performance lies at the core of
our combined estimation and detection problem. To account for the
significance of estimation quality, we define an estimation performance
measure and seek to optimize it while ensuring, in parallel,
satisfactory detection performance. More precisely, we minimize the
estimation-related costs subject to appropriate constraints on the
tolerable levels of detection errors (missed-detection and false-alarm).
This approach will lead to a novel combined test that provides the
operator with the freedom to strike any desired balance between the
quality of estimation and detection.
C. Definitions
We denote the true hypothesis and the decision of the detector
by T 2 fH0; H1g and D 2 fH0; H1g, respectively. Therefore, the
probabilities of missed-detection and false alarm are given by
and
Pmis = P(D = H0 j T = H1) ;
Pfa = P(D = H1 j T = H0) ;
(7)
(8)
204
respectively. Once we decide that the observation y is drawn from
hypothesis H1, we are also interested in providing an estimate b^(y)
for b. We capture the quality of the estimate by defining a cost
function C(b; b^(y)) corresponding to estimate b^(y). Two popular
cost functions corresponding to the minimum mean-square error
(MMSE) and maximum a-posteriori probability (MAP) estimation
criteria are
MMSE :
C(b; u) = ∥b
and
MAP :
C(b; u) =
{ 0
1
u∥
otherwise
≪ 1
:
For a given cost function C(u; b) we also define the average posterior
cost function, which assesses the estimation error cost after observing
y. The posterior cost function is
u∥2 ;
∥b
where the expectation is with respect to b for given y. Therefore, the
minimum posterior cost is
Cp(u j y) =△ Eb[C(b; u) j y]
where
=
=
∫ C(b; u)f1(y j b) (b) db
∫ f1(y j b) (b) db
∫ C(b; u)f1(y j b) (b) db
f1(y)
;
and the minimizer of the posterior cost, which is the well-known
Bayesian estimator, is [19, pp. 142]
Cp (y) =△ inf Cp(u j y) ;
u
b^ (y) =△ arg inf Cp(u j y) :
u
Note that Cp (y) plays an important role in designing the estimator
and detector as it captures the quality of estimation.
D. Problem Formulation
We next propose a performance measure that incorporates both
estimation and detection qualities. Optimizing this performance measure
defines the detection strategy and the estimator. In order to model
the detection strategy we deploy a randomized test f 0(y); 1(y)g,
where i(y), for i = 1; 2, denotes the randomization probability for
deciding in favor of Hi. Clearly i(y) 0 and 0(y) + 1(y) = 1.
For given randomization probabilities f 0(y); 1(y)g and an estimator
b^, we define the following performance measure.
J ( 0; 1; b^) =△ E1;b[C(b; b^(y)) j D = H1]
=
E1;b[C(b; b^(y)) 1fD=H1g] ;
P(D = H1 j T = H1)
where the expectation is over b and y under H1. Note that the
estimate b^(y) should be provided only when we decide in favor of
H1. Moreover, the average of C(b; b^(y)) is reasonable only under
the alternative hypothesis H1 as there is no true b under nominal
H0. Therefore, we compute the average estimation cost over the
event fD = H1g, which is the only case for which an estimate
is available. In order to incorporate mechanisms for controlling the
detection performance, we constrain the estimation cost optimization
problem with the upper bound constraints on the missed-detection
and false-alarm probabilities as:
Pmis
and
Pfa

E. Solution
In this section we briefly provide the structures of the estimators
and the detectors. The proofs are omitted for the sake of brevity and
follow the same line of arguments as the results in [20].
Lemma 1: Solving (14) can be decoupled into minimizing over b^

are selected such that the two constraints Pfa
are satisfied with equality. Also, the estimator is
b^(y) = b^ (y) :
Remark 5: When the observation noise term Z has the standard
complex Gaussian distribution, given the model in (8), the distributions
f0(y) and f1(y) are complex Gaussian with means 0 and b,
respectively, and covariance matrix I. Also an appropriate choice for
the cost function is the MMSE cost.
Therefore, we can pose the joint estimation and detection problem
as the following optimization problem:
Solving (14)-(15) is not necessarily feasible for any arbitrary choices
of and . The following remark summarizes the coupled valid
choices of and that make P feasible.
Remark 3: By setting the tolerable level of false alarm probability
at , the probability of missed-detection is known to be minimized
by the Neyman-Pearson test. Let us define ( ) as the minimum
missed-detection probability yielded by the Neyman-Pearson test.
Clearly the two constraints
Pfa
and
Pmis
;
are feasible simultaneously only if ( ) .
Remark 4: The observation above indicates that the proposed
framework trades some detection quality, by tolerating errors beyond
that achievable by the Neyman-Pearson test, in favor of enhancing
the estimation quality. Allowing for such a tradeoff between
estimation and detection qualities offers the freedom of putting
appropriate/desired emphasis on the detection or the estimation part,
depending on the application.

V. DISTRIBUTED DETECTION-ESTIMATION OF ATTACKS
In this section we focus on a distributed solution for the joint
attack detection and system state recovery problem, whose centralized
counterpart was developed in Section IV. For operational purposes,
the current electricity grid may be viewed as a large collection
of interconnected RTOs. The sheer large size of the grid and the
environmental unpredictability often make centralized information
processing tasks infeasible. This problem will manifest itself more
acutely in the future especially with the incorporation of numerous
diverse sources of power generation and consumption distributed
throughout the grid. As an alternative to centralized information
processing, we propose a fully distributed approach in this section, in
which the geographically distributed controlling agents in the network
collaborate by means of iterative local processing and message
passing to achieve system-wide attack detection and state recovery.
Referring to the (centralized) decomposition in (7), as shown in
Section IV-A, the useful information about the attack vector B is
embedded only in y, the component of the observation vector Y
in the null space of H. For computational purposes, the orthogonal
complement yy is simply the projection of Y onto the range space
of H. Writing
yy = HX + by + zy
we note that yy = H lc, where lc corresponds to the least squares
estimate of (HX + by) based on Y . It then follows that,
y = Y
H lc = (I
H(HT H) 1HT ) Y ;
(21)
(22)
assuming H is full rank, i.e., the system is observable. The optimal
centralized detection-estimation test (Theorem 2) is based on the
statistic y, which in turn depends on the global observation vector
Y .
Here we consider a framework for performing distributed
detection-estimation of B. To this end, let N denote the number
of substations (nodes), which may be quite large depending on
the region of interest. Accordingly, the observation vector Y is a
collection of local observation vectors, Y = [Y 1T ; ; Y TN ]T , where
Y n denotes the observation of the n-th node and is generated as
follows:
Y n = HnX + Zn + Bn ;
(23)
where Hn corresponds to the local Jacobian, and with Zn and
Bn being the portions of the noise and attack vector respectively
influencing the measurements at node n. Due to the large size of
the grid, it is often desirable, to compute the statistic of interest in a
distributed fashion, whereby nodes iteratively exchange information
to reproduce the value y locally. Such distributed computation
relieves a centralized fusion center of a possible communication
bottleneck and requires each node to know its local Hn and Y n only.
In the absence of malicious data attacks, the problem of distributed
state estimation in smart grids was addressed in [21] (see also [22]),
which introduced a distributed least-squares algorithm M CSE for
computing lc at each node. However, in the presence of injection
attacks, as shown in Section IV, the optimal detection-estimation
task is no longer a direct computation of lc from y, but involves
the computation of the attack sufficient statistic y. This sufficient
statistic y is used for the joint detection-estimation of the attack
(Theorem 2). The attack estimate thus obtained is used to eliminate
the effect of B from the observation vector Y and subsequently the
system state X is recovered by performing a least squares estimation
using the residual observation yy. In this paper, we introduce a nontrivial
variant of M CSE , the DA algorithm, for the distributed
computation of the attack sufficient statistic y at each node, which
is the fundamental building block in joint attack detection-estimation
and subsequent state-recovery. This, in turn, allows each node in the
network to compute the optimal detector-estimator of the attack and
subsequently recover the system state.
A. Algorithm DA and Convergence
The goal of this section is to design and analyze the distributed
scheme DA, in which each node converges almost surely to the
centralized sufficient statistic y. In particular, we show that the
DA algorithm leads to such convergence at each node, under the
assumption of global observability and connectivity of the inter-node
communication network. Before proceeding to the details, we note
that the DA scheme introduced here can be modified suitably to 1)
yield more general observation functionals (statistics) at each node,
including the 2 statistic often used for bad data detection and identification;
2) deal with nonlinear observation models; and 3) operate in
unpredictable environments with random inter-sensor communication
failures or transmission noises. Some of these generalizations were
studied in [23] in the context of general parameter estimation. Recall
the observation model at the n-th node:
Y n = HnX + Zn + Bn ;
where Y n is the local observation vector at the n-th node. We make
the following assumption on global observability.
(E.1)-Observability: The matrix
is of full-rank.
Starting from an initial deterministic estimate of y (the initial state
may be random, but here we assume it is deterministic for notational
simplicity), denoted by xn(0), each node generates by a distributed
iterative algorithm a sequence of estimates, fxn(i)gi 0. The estimate
xn(i + 1) of y at the n-th node at time i + 1 is a function of: 1) its
previous estimate; 2) the communicated estimates at time i from its
neighboring nodes; and 3) the local observation Y n.
Algorithm DA: Based on the current state xn(i), the exchanged
data fxl(i)gl2Ωn , and the observation Y n, we update the estimate
at the n-th node by the following distributed iterative algorithm:
[ ]
xn(i + 1) = xn(i)
(i)
∑ (xn(i)
xl(i))
(i)PnT [Y n
l2Ωn
Hn x^n(i)
Pnxn(i)] ;
(26)
where Pn is an mn m selection matrix that selects the components
of xn(i) corresponding to the location of Y n in the vector Y , with
Y n 2 Rmn and Y 2 Rm. The auxiliary state sequence fx^n(i)g at
each node n is also generated according to a distributed scheme,
N
G = ∑ HTn Hn
n=1
(24)
(25)
(27)
x^n(i + 1) = x^n(i)
[
(i)
∑ (x^n(i)
l2Ωn
x^l(i))
(i)HTn (Y n
]
Hnx^n(i)) :
In (26)-(27), f (i)g; f (i)g; f (i)g are appropriately chosen timevarying
weight sequences. Algorithm DA is distributed since at
node n it involves only the data from the nodes in its communication
neighborhood Ωn. In order to implement the DA, each node stores
and updates two states, xn(i), the estimate of y, and x^n(i), an
auxiliary state used for the update of xn(i).

Now we formally refer to the recursive estimation algorithm
in (26)-(27) as DA. We note that the estimate sequence fxn(i)g
is random, due to the stochasticity of the noise. The following
assumption on the connectivity of the inter-node communication
network is assumed:
(E.2)-Connectivity: The inter-node communication network determined
by the communication neighborhoods Ωn is connected.3
(E.3)-Time varying weights: The sequences f (i)g and f (i)g are
of the form
(i) =
a
(i + 1) 1
and
(i) =
b
(i + 1) 2
;
where a; b > 0 are constants and the exponents 1 and 2 satisfy
0 < 1
1 and 0 < 2 < 1 :
The sequence (i) is of the form
where c > 0 is a constant and the exponent 3 satisfies
(i) =
c
(i + 1) 3
;
0 < 3
1 :
Remark 6: A key thing to note is that, although the weights are
decaying over time, i.e., (i); (i); (i) ! 0 as i ! 1, they are
persistent, i.e.,
∑ (i) = 1;
i 0
∑ (i) = 1; and ∑ (i) = 1 :
i 0
i 0
Whereas the decaying nature of the weight sequences guarantee
convergence, the persistence condition is necessary to drive the
estimators to y from arbitrary initial conditions.
The following result characterizes the convergence of the individual
node estimates fxn(i)g to the desired sufficient statistic y.
Theorem 3: Consider the DA under (E.1)-(E.3). Then, for each n,
the estimate sequence fxn(i)g converges a.s. to the sufficient statistic
y, i.e.,
(
P lim xn(i) = y
i!1
)
= 1
8n :
The convergence rate in Theorem 3 depends on the choice of the
various weight sequences. The proven convergence above allows each
node in a distributed way to compute the centralized sufficient statistic
y needed for the construction of the optimal detector-estimator of the
attack vector B.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper we have studied the problem of distributed state
estimation in smart grids with malicious injection data attacks.
Our approach is unified, in that, it presents a joint detectionestimation
framework for simultaneous attack detection and system
state recovery. Under varying scenarios of the attacker's information
resources, we have characterized optimal tests and procedures for
attack detection and state estimation. Furthermore, we have provided
a completely distributed approach based on local processing and message
passing that enables each network node to compute the global
sufficient statistic for performing the optimal detection-estimation
task. Convergence of our distributed scheme is guaranteed as long as
the physical model is observable and the inter-node communication
network is connected.
3We note here that the cyber communication neighborhood could be
significantly different and sparser than the physical neighborhood determined
by electrical connections.
