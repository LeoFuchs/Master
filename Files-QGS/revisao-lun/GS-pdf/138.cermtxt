Abstract-Preserving the availability and integrity of the power
grid critical infrastructures in the face of fast-spreading intrusions
requires advances in detection techniques specialized for such
large-scale cyber-physical systems. In this paper, we present a
security-oriented cyber-physical state estimation (SCPSE) system,
which, at each time instant, identifies the compromised set of
hosts in the cyber network and the maliciously modified set of
measurements obtained from power system sensors. SCPSE fuses
uncertain information from different types of distributed sensors,
such as power system meters and cyber-side intrusion detectors,
to detect the malicious activities within the cyber-physical system.
We implemented a working prototype of SCPSE and evaluated
it using the IEEE 24-bus benchmark system. The experimental
results show that SCPSE significantly improves on the scalability
of traditional intrusion detection techniques by using information
from both cyber and power sensors. Furthermore, SCPSE was
able to detect all the attacks against the control network in our
experiments.

I. INTRODUCTION
T whose reliable operation depends critically on its cyber
HE POWER GRID is a large interconnected system
infrastructure. A taxonomy of major cyber-physical interdependencies
in the power grid is explored in [1]. For reliable
operation of such a cyber-physical system, it is necessary to
be aware of the state of both the physical and cyber infrastructures
and their interdependencies. Today, the reliability of the
interdependent power and cyber infrastructures making up the
grid is largely managed through employment of redundant
components and communication pathways that make it possible
to operate through failures and faults that occur naturally.
However, such an approach does not adequately protect against
cyber adversaries. Until recently, perimeter security controls
and lack of connectivity of power control networks to external
networks were considered sufficient barriers against cyber
adversaries. The increasing connectivity of power grid control

networks to and through corporate and enterprise networks,
and the advent of malware (e.g., Stuxnet) that can jump air
gaps, call for more holistic solutions. This paper presents a security-oriented
cyber-physical state estimation solution SCPSE
that uses information from both power and cyber sensors to
identify cyber attacks and potential compromises of power
system measurement data for improved situational awareness.
From a data perspective, power systems consist of data acquisition,
transmission, and processing. The information path from
the field to end-point applications in the electric power grid is
enabled by measurement devices and communication systems.
The data integrity within the information path may be low for
many reasons, including misconfigurations, sensor or communication
failures, or coordinated false data injection attacks. Indeed,
noisy data are constantly present in the system because
of failures and misconfigurations, yet the system maintains a
high level of reliability due to mechanisms put in place to detect
and deal with such data. However, recent research [2] has
shown that maliciously coordinated false data injection attacks
may be able to bypass traditional mechanisms put in place to detect
noisy data, and that such attacks may impact power system
applications, such as optimal generation dispatch and real-time
prices, as operators and applications respond to the manipulated
system state estimate [3]-[5]. Arguably, false data injection attacks
and their impacts need to be studied further and validated
in realistic environments. However, it is important to design effective
defenses against this threat.
Further, anytime cyber intruders are in the system, even if
they are not altering values to cause malicious consequences,
the fact that they possess the access and the ability to make such
modifications is a threat. The presence of such adversaries in
the system needs to be resolved immediately. SCPSE has been
designed for that purpose.
1) Contribution: We propose SCPSE, a cyber-physical datafusion
framework that uses stochastic information fusion algorithms
and merges sensor information from both the cyber and
electrical infrastructures that comprise the power grid to detect
intrusions and malicious data, and to assess the cyber-physical
system state. SCPSE exploits the interrelation among the cyber
and physical components of the power grid by leveraging information
about both the cyber and electrical infrastructures,
and offers more complete situational awareness than is currently
possible with existing solutions.
Specifically, SCPSE utilizes information provided by alerts
from intrusion detection systems (IDSes) that monitor the cyber
infrastructure for malicious or abnormal activity, in conjunction
with knowledge about the communication network topology
and the output of a traditional state estimator (which leverages
physical power system topology and power system measurements).
Thus, SCPSE is able to provide meaningful feedback

on the cyber-physical state of the system, leading to improved
situational awareness and the ability to respond. While the focus
of this work is on maliciously altered data, SCPSE is agnostic
to the specific form of the attack.
Section II describes SCPSE functionality and how it addresses
the needs of the power industry. Details of the SCPSE
cyber and power state estimation are presented in Sections III
and IV. The computational efficiency of SCPSE is discussed
in Section V. A prototype implementation and its experimental
results are presented in Section VI. Sections VII and VIII
review past related work and conclude the paper.
II. SCPSE ARCHITECTURE
1) SCPSE Data Flow: Fig. 1 presents a high-level overview
of SCPSE and how its components are interconnected. Before
SCPSE begins its online operation, it uses the power network's
access control policies, e.g., firewall rules, and automatically
generates an attack graph, called an attack graph template
(AGT). The state transitions in an AGT encode all possible
attack paths that an attacker can traverse by sequences of
vulnerability exploitations. Furthermore, SCPSE takes an
underlying power system model and calculates a base-case
power flow solution (Fig. 1), which reveals how power system
measurements should be correlated.
During the operational mode, SCPSE monitors the physical
power and communication networks, detects and analyzes
attacks based on the attack graph, and then probabilistically
determines the set of computer systems and power system
measurements that are likely to have been maliciously compromised.
SCPSE then uses that probabilistic information to
flag and handle suspicious measurements in order to protect the
power system from the potentially malicious data.
In particular, SCPSE uses the past sequence of triggered IDS
alerts to estimate the attack path in the AGT that has been traversed
by the adversary. Because of inherent uncertainties in
the reported IDS alert notifications, it is not always feasible to
determine the exact attack path traversed. Instead, at each time
instant, a posterior probability distribution over the AGT's state
space is calculated according to the false positive and negative
rates of the triggered and non-triggered IDS alerts, respectively.
That estimated probabilistic state knowledge reveals the set of
privilege domains, i.e., host systems, believed to be compromised
in the control network.
Potentially modified power measurements are identified
based on the given topological information regarding which
power sensors are managed or processed by the estimated set of
compromised hosts. The IDS reports and the correspondingly
updated power system state estimator outputs enable SCPSE to
provide situational awareness by continuously presenting operators
with clear and complete information on the cyber-physical
state of the power grid.
The combined security state of the power grid is defined in
this work as a binary vector that consists of information related
to two types of malicious events. First, there are vulnerability
exploitations, in which the adversary works to obtain specific
privileges in the system. The first set of bits in a state indicates
whether a particular privilege domain, e.g., the root domain on
the historian server, has been compromised. Second, there are
malicious consequences of the attack after a privilege has been
obtained. Specifically, we define consequences as violations of
the CIA criteria (i.e., confidentiality, integrity, and availability)
applied to critical assets in the power grid. For example, the
integrity of a file , which is used to control a power
relay, is compromised if the file is maliciously modified, leading
to a status change of the underlying relay.
The cyber-physical security state encodes the compromised
host systems and the maliciously modified power measurements.
By estimating the cyber-physical state and relaying it
to operators, we are capable of responding to attacks. Network
administrators should develop response strategies for security
attacks that may occur. The strategies may include automated
intrusion response systems. SCPSE neither proposes a new type
of sensor nor presents an automated response mechanism. The
main objective of SCPSE is to provide situational awareness of
the power grid infrastructures to the operators and the response
systems in charge of taking care of the detected problems.
III. CYBER SECURITY-STATE ESTIMATION
As outlined in Section II, from the power network's access
control policies, SCPSE generates an AGT and uses it to estimate
the compromised set of hosts, given the IDS alerts.
The power network's access control policies are composed of
rules about sources (IP/port addresses) that are either allowed
or not allowed to reach a destination. SCPSE parses the rulesets
and creates a binary network connectivity matrix that is a Cartesian
product of host systems. The entry of the matrix takes
on a true value if the traffic from host to host is allowed,
and a false value if it is not allowed. The connectivity matrix
always includes an Internet node representing a group of hosts
outside of the network where attackers are assumed to initially
reside.
1) Attack Graph Template Generation: Generally, every
cyber attack path consists of an escalating series of vulnerability
exploitations by the adversary, who initially has no access to
the system (privilege) but then achieves the privilege required
to reach his or her attack goals, e.g., modifying a power sensor
measurement. Regardless of the type of the vulnerability, every
vulnerability exploitation (e.g., a malicious buffer overflow
against the human-machine interface (HMI) server in the power
network) will provide the attacker with control on the corresponding
host computer (e.g., the HMI server in the previous
example). For instance, let us consider a host system (e.g.,
an RTU) that is in charge of sending the sensor measurements
1792
IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID, VOL. 3, NO. 4, DECEMBER 2012
on one of the power system buses to the state estimation server.
To modify the sensor measurement data, the attacker needs
to get control over . For example, if the attacker has gotten
control over the HMI server (from the above example), he or
she further needs to exploit a vulnerability in the system so
that he or she can modify the measurements. However, access
from the HMI server to the system should be allowed by the
network firewall rules (so-called network global access control
policies); otherwise, any attempt by the attacker on the HMI
server to access the system will be denied automatically by
the firewalls. In particular, SCPSE takes into account the global
access control policies that enumerate all possible attack paths
that the attackers can traverse through the power grid network.
We present the attack graph template (AGT), i.e., an extended
attack graph, which represents all possible attack paths (unlike
traditional attack graphs [6], which only address previously
known paths). To further clarify, an AGT, by design, would
address a zero-day (previously unknown) buffer overflow exploitation
of a historian server process, while a traditional attack
graph would be unaware of it. An AGT is a state-based directed
graph, in which a state is defined as the set of compromised privilege
domains. Therefore, the initial state is , in which the
attacker does not yet have any privileges over the power network.
Each state transition represents a privilege escalation that
is achieved through a vulnerability exploitation. Therefore, any
path on the AGT graph represents an attack path in the power
network.
To generate an AGT, SCPSE pessimistically considers every
host within the power network to be a single potentially vulnerable
privilege domain. In particular, SCPSE automatically generates
an AGT by traversing the connectivity matrix and concurrently
updating the AGT. First, SCPSE creates the AGT's initial state
and starts the AGT generation with the network's entry
point (Internet) node in the connectivity matrix. Considering
the connectivity matrix as a directed graph, SCPSE runs a
depth-first search (DFS) on the graph. While the DFS is
recursively traversing the graph, it keeps track of the current
state in the AGT, i.e., the set of privileges already gained
through the path traversed so far by the DFS. When the DFS
meets a graph edge that crosses over privilege domains
to , a state transition in the AGT is created if the current
state in the AGT does not include the privilege domain of the
host to which the edge leads, i.e., . The transition in the
AGT is between the current state and the state that includes
exactly the same privilege set as the current state plus the host
directed by the graph edge . The AGT's current state
in the algorithm is then updated to the latter state, and the
algorithm proceeds until no further updates to the AGT are
possible according to the connectivity matrix. At that point,
the offline AGT generation is complete, and by design, the
AGT includes all possible attack paths launching from remote
(Internet) host systems against the network. Fig. 2 shows a
highly simplified power network and its corresponding AGT
model. Connectivity matrix elements are indicated with dashed
arrows among network component pairs.
2) AGT-to-HMM Conversion: The AGT is converted to a
hidden Markov model (HMM) [7], which will be used later to
determine the attack path traversed by the attacker at each time
instant, given the past set of triggered IDS alerts.
To generate the HMM model, SCPSE enhances the AGT
using the cyber network's topology to encapsulate knowledge
Fig. 2. A highly simplified power network and the corresponding AGT.
about deployed cyber-side IDSes. Specifically, each AGT edge
is tagged by a (possibly empty) set of IDSes that monitor the
edge's corresponding network link within the power network.
SCPSE later uses these tags to map IDS alerts (observations) to
their corresponding state transitions to estimate the attack path
traversed by the attacker. In practice, IDSes tend to report false
positives and may also miss some incidents, i.e., false negatives.
To account for the inherent uncertainties in IDS alert notifications,
SCPSE labels the IDS tags on state transitions with their
false positive and negative rates.
3) Cyber Security-State Estimation: During its online operation,
SCPSE makes use of the HMM model and online IDS
alerts to probabilistically deduce the attacker's previous actions
(vulnerability exploitations), and hence the set of already compromised
host systems. Indeed, IDS alerts provide SCPSE with
the online information about the cyber-side security incidents
and compromises. There are two major types of IDS solutions
that can be used to pinpoint adversarial cyber penetrations: 1)
host-based techniques that run and monitor for misbehaviors
within host systems, such as file integrity checkers and CPU/
memory overconsumption monitors; and 2) network-based solutions
that run on network devices and hence are easier to deploy,
and look for attack signatures and anomalies based on limited
available information obtained from the packet headers and
payloads, if the traffic is not encrypted. For SCPSE, the specific
type of the IDS system is not relevant, and the only information
needed is the intrusion detection accuracy level; that can be assigned
by security admins or historical data analysis techniques
[8]. SCPSE makes use of the HMM to track the attacker's action
sequence as the IDS alerts are sequentially triggered. To do
so, SCPSE uses an HMM smoothing algorithm [7] to estimate
the network's current security state given the past triggered IDS
alerts. In an HMM, unlike a regular Markov model, states are
not directly visible, but observations (IDS alerts) are visible.
The goal is to utilize the past observation sequence and probabilistically
estimate the traversed state sequence (attack path)
considering the false positive and negative rates of the monitoring
IDS probes.
Formally, SCPSE models each attack scenario as a discrete-time
hidden Markov process, i.e., event sequence
of arbitrary length. ,
where is an HMM state at the th step of the attack and is
unobserved, and the observation is the set of triggered IDS
alerts at that step. The initial state is defined as , as
discussed above.

1793
SCPSE's main responsibility is to compute , that
is, the probability distribution over hidden states at each time
instant, given the HMM model and the past IDS alerts
. In particular, SCPSE makes use of the forwardbackward
smoothing algorithm [7], which, in the first pass, calculates
the probability of ending up in any particular HMM state
given the first IDS alerts in the sequence . In the
second pass, the algorithm computes a set of backward probabilities
that provide the probability of receiving the remaining observations
given any starting point , i.e., . The
two probability distributions can then be combined to obtain the
distribution over states at any specific point in time given the entire
observation sequence,
(1)
where the last step follows from an application of Bayes's rule
and the conditional independence of and given .
Having solved the HMM's smoothing problem for ,
SCPSE probabilistically knows about the current cyber security
state, i.e., the set of compromised host systems. Next, our goal is
to use the knowledge of current cyber security state to accurately
estimate the underlying power system state.
IV. POWER SYSTEM STATE ESTIMATION
As discussed before, the cyber-physical security state of the
power grid is defined for SCPSE as the set of compromised
host systems and maliciously modified power measurements. In
Section III, we introduced an algorithm to probabilistically determine
the set of compromised hosts at each time instant. This
section explains how SCPSE uses the knowledge about compromised
hosts to identify the set of maliciously modified power
measurements, the so-called bad data. The bad-data detection
enables SCPSE to estimate the underlying power system state
correctly.
1) Background: Before presenting the bad-data detection algorithm,
we provide a brief review on the power system flow
equations and state estimation. In a power grid infrastructure,
the underlying power system is represented as a set of nonlinear
AC equations that include active and reactive power flows,
(2)
(3)
where and are, respectively, active and reactive power
flows from bus to bus . and denote the elements in
the , position of the real and imaginary components of the
system admittance matrix , which contains the
network line parameters [9].
The power system state estimation problem involves estimation
of the present conditions in a power system based on snapshots
of real-time measurements, i.e., real and reactive power.
The estimated quantities include bus voltage magnitudes and
angles that constitute the power system state variables. The estimate
is computed using known equations, which relate the
power system measurements to the unknown states that are to
be estimated. The estimates depend on the power flow equations
that are derived from the power system topology. For example,
in (2) and (3), the values of and are measured
by the power sensors, and the values of the power system state
vector (i.e., voltage magnitudes and phase angles ), are estimated
using the iterative Newton-Raphson state estimation
equations [9]. Once the state variables, i.e., bus voltage phasors,
are known, all other quantities, such as currents and nonmeasured
real and reactive line flows, can be computed [9].
In general, power system state estimation is typically an
overdetermined problem, since there are more measurements
available than are needed to solve for the unknown voltage
magnitudes and angles. In other words, the power system state
estimation server can still estimate the power state correctly
if redundant measurements are ignored. However, in a practical
attack-free situation, power measurements may include
zero-mean Gaussian noise due to natural and accidental faults.
Therefore, deployment of redundant power sensors improves
the accuracy of power system state estimation.
In certain cases, it is possible for modified measurements
to cause incorrect power system estimates without being detected.
These unobservable attacks must satisfy the power balance
equations.
2) Bad-Data Detection: Many proposed schemes exist for
bad-measurement identification [10]. In [2], [11]-[13], it is
shown that traditional detection schemes are ineffective against
coordinated malicious false data injection. Residual-based
approaches [9] are the most widely used techniques for handling
nonmalicious accidental failures. In summary, those
algorithms examine the -norm of the measurement residual
, i.e., the difference between the true measurements
and the estimated values of the measurements , which
are calculated using the power system state estimate and
the system matrix . The measurements whose -norm is
greater than a certain threshold are marked as bad data.
However, unobservable false-data injection attacks [11] prove
the inability of residual-based techniques to handle interacting
or malicious bad-data modifications [14], as they can change
the estimates without impacting the residual. The failure of
such techniques results from their dependence on computation
of an initial estimate using all the measurements, which may
be affected by the bad data.
To identify malicious data modifications, we present a new
scalable and combinatorial-based bad-data detection (BDD) algorithm.
The algorithm makes use of the power measurements
as well as the cyber security state estimation result, i.e., the posterior
distribution over the HMM's state space
(Section III). The main idea is to circumvent the problem of
needing to compute the initial power system estimate from
the full data set by initially throwing out the set of suspicious
measurements. A trivial solution would be to blindly consider
each combination of the sensors to be corrupted, then estimate
the power system state for each combination without using measurements
from those sensors, and finally calculate
to identify the true corrupted measurements. However, that ap1794
IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID, VOL. 3, NO. 4, DECEMBER 2012
proach is not generally scalable for use in large-scale power systems,
as sensors yield possible combinations. As discussed
below, SCPSE uses the posterior distribution
to order and limit the number of combinations to check.
SCPSE implements Algorithm 1 to detect maliciously bad
power measurements. The main inputs (Line 1) are the cyber
security state estimation result , the power system
measurements, and a timeout threshold for the algorithm.
SCPSE initially orders the HMM states in descending order
according to the estimated posterior probability
(Line 3). Then, SCPSE iteratively checks combinations of
measurements (Line 4). In particular, the most likely HMM
state is first picked from the list (Line 5). Using the power
grid topology, SCPSE knows which measurements could or
might have been corrupted, given the set of compromised hosts
encoded by . The set of potentially corrupted measurements is
stored in a binary vector (Line 6). To clarify, assuming that
there are a total of measurements, is a binary vector
in which 1 s and 0 s represent bad and good measurements, respectively.
For instance, none of the measurements are marked
as potentially corrupted in the measurement combination
.
The idea is to throw away the measurements that correspond
to the 1 values in , and proceed with the normal state estimation
routine using the remaining measurements. Given the calculated
, rows of the and matrices that correspond to the
1 values in are deleted, and the results are saved in and
(Line 7). Using the dimensionally reduced matrices and ,
the power system state is then estimated (Line 9). The state estimate
is used to reconstruct the estimated measurement vector
, which is compared to the actual measurements (Line
10). During each iteration of the algorithm, the most deviating
so far and the related values are stored (Line 12). In essence,
each iteration (Line 4) checks a specific set of potentially bad
measurements to determine whether or not they differ significantly
from the values they should have, which are computed
based on the remaining (good) measurements. Finally, the procedure
returns the best estimates for the power system state, and
the set of measurements that were identified as corrupted (Line
1).
One main point in the algorithm is the observability condition
(Line 8), which checks whether it is possible to estimate the
power system state while ignoring a particular subset of measurements
. Otherwise, if too many measurements are compromised
and must be removed, the system will no longer be observable,
and the algorithm will not be able to proceed with that
Fig. 3. SCPSE implementation setup.
particular iteration (Line 8). In general, for a power system to
be observable, it is necessary for the number of available measurements
to be equal to or larger than the number of power
system state variables. However, it may be that only parts of
the network are observable and some other parts of the system
are not observable, even if the total number of good measurements
is sufficient. Hence, it is not only important that there
be enough good measurements, but also that they come from
well-distributed parts of the underlying power system. The entire
power system is said to be observable if all state variables
can be estimated based on the given measurements. Further discussion
of observability analysis is beyond the scope of this
paper. The interested reader is referred to the literature concerning
measurement placement for observability [10].
It is worth stressing that Algorithm 1 provides bad-data
detection mainly for malicious cases and is a supplement to,
rather than a replacement for, residual-based approaches, which
are suitable for detecting noninteracting and natural errors.
The proposed algorithm is, in essence, a combinatorial-based
solution that makes use of cyber-side IDS reports to improve
its scalability. In the case of natural errors, IDS reports would
not provide any useful information, and hence the proposed
algorithm could not always identify corrupted measurements
within a short amount of time. Consequently, the proposed
approach and traditional residual-based techniques should be
used together to achieve efficient detection of measurement
corruptions due to both security attacks and accidental errors.
V. COMPUTATIONAL EFFICIENCY
Power systems are large, sparse systems in which each bus
is connected to at most a few other buses. Thus, power systems
analysis takes advantage of sparsity in its computations of network
solutions [15], [16]. Likewise, the same sparsity that permits
the efficient solution of large-scale power networks also
permits efficient solution of the possible communications attack
paths. SCPSE takes advantage of the network's topological
sparsity and uses an approximation algorithm (discussed
below) to ensure feasibility of the proposed estimation algorithms
on large-scale power networks. SCPSE employs a modified
version of the envelope [17] algorithm to concentrate computational
resources on only the most relevant states. In particular,
at each time instant , given the HMM smoothing results
, SCPSE picks the state with the highest probability
using the Most Likely State (MLS) [18] approximation
technique . Then, SCPSE partially
generates the AGT, starting with the state and exploring all
possible state sequences shorter than a predefined threshold

that are reachable from . The generated partial AGT is used
by SCPSE to perform the next round of HMM smoothing to update
the distribution. Once the power system
bad-data detection using has been accomplished,
SCPSE starts the next iteration by updating the AGT
using the updated distribution and waiting to receive the next
sequence of observables.
VI. EVALUATION
1) Evaluation Methodology: We implemented and evaluated
a working prototype of SCPSE on the IEEE 24-bus power
system benchmark. Our experimental results show that the generated
attack graph and the underlying physical power system
allow SCPSE to efficiently fuse sensor information and hence
identify malicious activities accurately.
In this section, we discuss our implementations and present
the experimental results. All our experiments were on a 32-bit
system with an Intel Core 2 2.16 GHz CPU, 3.00 GB of memory,
and the Windows 7 Professional operating system.
2) Implementations: Fig. 3 shows a high-level overview of
our implementation setup. A unified XML format was used
to describe the network topology and global access control
policies. During the offline phase, SCPSE leverages the NetAPT
tool [19] to connect to firewalls in the network using
a secure SSL channel and perform a comprehensive security
analysis of the access policy rules. It then produces the network
connectivity matrix according to the control network topology
input. The matrix is later translated into an HMM model
through an AGT generation step (Section III). As illustrated in
Fig. 3, during the online phase, SCPSE feeds the previously
triggered IDS alerts to an HMM solver (the UMDHMM tool
[20]) to solve the HMM model for the posterior distribution
and estimate the cyber security state of the system.
On the power side, we employed PowerWorld Simulator [21]
to simulate the underlying power system model, shown as the
power system topology input in Fig. 3. PowerWorld was used

generation overhead. (c) HMM solution overhead. (d) BDD solution overhead.
to produce online power measurements and to send them in
real-time to the power state estimation component (the MATPOWER
MATLAB toolbox [22]). To set up a real-time connection
to MATLAB, PowerWorld used its SimAuto toolbox
[23] via MATLAB. Finally, the power system state estimate
from MATPOWER and the cyber security state estimate from
UMDHMM were used by Algorithm 1 to determine the cyberphysical
security state of the power grid.
In our experiments, we evaluated SCPSE on a simulated
power grid infrastructure. The underlying power system was
the IEEE 24-bus reliability test system [24] [Fig. 4(a)]. The
power system consisted of 38 transmission lines, and each
line had two power sensors on each of its ends, measuring
real and reactive power. The power system was monitored
and controlled by two control center networks with identical
network topologies and access control policies. The simplified
control network models were built based on the topology of
a real power control network (which will remain anonymous
because of a nondisclosure agreement). Fig. 4(b) shows the
1796

topology of a single control center network that has 59 nodes,
e.g., host systems and firewalls. As shown in the figure, the
Internet connections come from the node marked as Internet
Host (28.1.1.1), which is assumed to be where the attacker
resides initially. The first control network monitors and controls
buses 1-12 in the power system [Fig. 4(a)], and the second
network monitors and controls buses 13-24. In particular, each
power bus is monitored and controlled by a single host system
in the corresponding control network. That mapping is later
used by the implementation of the proposed bad-data algorithm
to determine which measurements the attacker could have
modified, given that he or she has compromised a particular
host system.
3) Performance Analysis: We evaluated SCPSE's scalability
for large-scale power grid networks with thousands of
buses. Although network topology analysis and AGT model
generation in SCPSE are performed during an offline phase,
in practice, it is still important to complete those steps within
a reasonable time interval. To validate SCPSE's efficiency on
various power grid networks with different sizes and topologies,
we measured how long SCPSE takes to generate the
AGT model for randomly generated power grid networks.
Fig. 5(a) and (b) show the AGT generation time requirement
and the model's size for power grid networks of various sizes.
In particular, the sizes, shown on the horizontal axes, represent
the number of power system buses and communication control
network systems, as we used a one-to-one mapping between
the communication network nodes and the power system buses.
The threshold (Section V) was set to 8, i.e., the generated
AGT model took into account all possible adversarial future
action sequences whose lengths were shorter than 9. As shown
in the figures, the AGT model size and generation time grew
as the network size reached around 1000 nodes, and remained
stationary ( and )
afterwards. We also evaluated the performance of the HMM
solution component in SCPSE. As shown in Fig. 5(c), initially,
before the finite horizon threshold was hit, the HMM solution
time increased as the network size grew; however, it reached
its steady state of about 2 seconds for larger networks. Fig. 5(d)
shows our performance analysis results for Algorithm 1. In
particular, we measured how long it takes SCPSE to complete
the bad-data detection phase when different numbers of AGT
states are chosen to be investigated (Line 5 in the algorithm). It
takes about 8 seconds to initialize the algorithm, e.g., load the
power grid case, and approximately 0.08 seconds on average
for each state chosen from the list.

4) AGT Generation: Given the power network topology and
the access policy rules, i.e., about 100 firewall rules, SCPSE
constructed the network connectivity matrix and generated the
corresponding AGT model. Fig. 6 shows a simplified version of
the generated AGT. For presentation clarity, only a single host
in each network was considered during the AGT generation, and
host names in Fig. 6 are represented by encodings. Table I
shows the mappings between the encodings in Fig. 6 and the
host systems in Fig. 4(b). As shown in the generated AGT, the
attacker initially resides remotely in the Internet, with no privileges
in the power network (AGT state 0), and could traverse
different attack paths to access a particular host, e.g., , in the
power network. Each AGT edge represents an allowed access
(i.e., possibly a vulnerability exploitation) from a source to a
destination host in the power network.
5) Cyber Security-State Estimation: Our implementations
then converted the generated AGT to its corresponding hidden
Markov model (Section III) to allow probabilistic deduction of
the attack path that would reveal the set of compromised hosts.
The generated HMM maintained the same state space and namings
as the AGT illustrated in Fig. 6. Then, we launched an attack
to compromise the host system 101.10.0.3 within the power
network. The attack caused the IDS, which was monitoring the
host's incoming traffic, to trigger an alert. The UMDHMM tool
used the generated HMM and the triggered IDS alert to estimate
the cyber security state. Table II shows the probability distribution
over the HMM's state space. The most likely current state
in the HMM marks the host systems 28.1.1.1 and 101.10.0.3
as compromised. From the cyber-physical network's topology
input and given the compromised hosts, SCPSE marks the real
and reactive power measurements on transmission lines 1-2 and
16-17 as potentially corrupted1.
6) Bad-Data Detection: We evaluated how efficiently the
proposed bad-data detection algorithm performs compared to
the traditional residual-based approaches.

CYBER SECURITY-STATE ESTIMATION RESULTS
Fig. 7. Single measurement (sensor 1) corruption.
The first attack modified the measurements from a single
real power sensor on the 1-2 line after compromising a critical
power network host. Fig. 7 shows different parameters observed
after we ran both of the bad-data detection algorithms. The vertical
axis shows the real power per-unit values for 16 of the 38
total power system sensors (indicated on the horizontal axis).
For presentation clarity, not all 38 values are shown. For each of
the 16 sensors, four values are reported. The first column shows
the actual (correct) measurements from PowerWorld Simulator;
maliciously modified values are shown in the second column.
The third column shows the measurements estimated using the
proposed framework, which used the cyber-side intrusion detection
(ID) information. The last column reports the measurements
estimated using the traditional residual-based approach.
As shown in the figure, during the first scenario, only the measurement
from the first sensor on the 1-2 line was corrupted 1
p.u. before being sent to the estimation server. The proposed
ID-based solution's estimation of the first sensor's measurement,
0.1224, was almost equal to its correct value, 0.1247 (i.e.,
with only 0.002 p.u. difference), and hence far from its modified
value, resulting in a large measurement residual. The residualbased
algorithm was also able to detect the data corruption, as
its calculated measurement residual value, 0.502, was above the
predefined threshold . However, its estimated
value was not as accurate as that of the ID-based algorithm.
The estimated value was affected by the corrupted value that
was wrongly considered good and used by the state estimator
during the residual-based approach's first power state estimation.
The second attack aimed to cause noninteracting measurement
modifications on two power sensors. In particular, measurements
from the bus 1 sensor on the 1-2 line, and from the
bus 16 sensor on the 16-17 line, were corrupted. The corruptions
were both 1 p.u., and were intentionally designed not to
match the underlying power system equations. In practice, such
noninteracting bad data usually result from non-malicious natural
and accidental failures. Fig. 8 shows the measurement estimations
resulting from the two algorithms. Much as in the
Fig. 8. Multiple non-interacting measurement (sensors 1 and 27) corruption.
Fig. 9. Multiple interacting measurement (sensors 1 and 14) corruption.
case above, the proposed algorithm and the residual-based approach
were both able to detect the data corruption. However,
the residual-based approach did not estimate the power system
measurements of the compromised sensors accurately.
During a more complicated attack scenario, the attacker
intentionally modified two measurements from sensors 1 (on
bus 1) and 14 (on bus 2), which were monitoring the two ends
of the 1-2 power line. The data modifications were intentionally
designed in such a way that they still satisfied the power
flow equations (i.e., an unobservable attack). In particular,
the measurement corruptions on sensors 1 and 14 were
and , respectively. Fig. 9 shows the results for the
interacting measurement corruption scenario. The proposed
ID-based algorithm was still able to detect the measurement
corruption and correctly estimate the state by ignoring the set
of bad measurements. In comparison, the locally consistent
bad measurements deceived the residual-based approach into
wrongly marking those measurements as correct, since the
measurement residual value was 0.002, i.e., below the predefined
threshold . That example shows that SCPSE is effective
at detecting interacting malicious measurement corruption
attacks and producing an accurate estimate of the system state,
while residual-based approaches fail to detect such attacks and
thereby can lead to a faulty estimate.
We also evaluated SCPSE's ability to detect maliciously
altered power system measurements in our case study power
grid in 30 different cyber-originated attack scenarios. SCPSE's
HMM smoothing component took 914 ms on average to calculate
the posterior distribution for each attack over the state
space. SCPSE's detection component was able to identify the
exact subset of corrupted measurements in all the scenarios
within 11.7 seconds by going through no more than the first
14 states (across the attack scenarios) on the ordered state list
(Algorithm 1). That demonstrates that SCPSE has the potential
to assess the cyber-physical state of a system in real-time and
in the presence of adversaries.

VII. RELATED WORK
Recently, there has been increasing interest in security incident
detection in power-critical infrastructures [25], including
work on false data injection attacks [2] and defenses against
them. However, most of the past work has focused on either
cyber or power side solutions [26]-[28]. In this section, we
discuss some closely related work and contrast it with our approach.
We first discuss related work whose focus is on the dependability
and security analysis of power systems. Volkanovski et
al. [29] introduce a power system reliability analysis algorithm
using fault trees generated for each load point of the system.
The proposed method focuses only on accidental failures due to
natural causes, and hence does not consider maliciously failed
power components. Zhou et al. [30] present a sequential power
system state estimation algorithm that uses reports from synchronized
phasor measurement units. Lo et al. [31] propose a
power system bad-data detection algorithm based on rotation
of measurement order for sequential state estimation. [32], [33]
focus on detecting corrupted measurements using only power
sensors. Such bad-data detection techniques have two major
limitations. Detection accuracy of some approaches, e.g., leastsquare
error-based algorithms [33], is usually low against coordinated
attacks, as they initially consider all the measurements
good. Furthermore, some other approaches, e.g., combinational
techniques [32], do not scale well. Their search space for detecting
bad measurements grows exponentially with the number
of measurements.
Recent research has focused on false data injection attacks
[2], [28], [34] on state estimation, where an adversary modifies
multiple measurements in a coordinated fashion to influence
the estimate of the state without being detected by traditional
bad-data detection schemes, and on defenses against such
attacks (e.g., [28], [34], [35]). The impact of such false data injections
on power system operations, including power market
operations, has been considered in [3]-[5]. Specifically, [3], [4]
show that false data injection attacks can be used to manipulate
real-time prices in the electricity markets, while [5] shows that
they can cause operators to make suboptimal power dispatch decisions.
Kosut et al. [28] introduce an algorithm to detect and localize
false data injection attacks using the generalized likelihood ratio
test. However, that work does not take into account the cyber
network topology or its current state, which might be the root
cause of the problem; hence, it does not provide a complete
cyber-physical picture.
Bobba et al. [34] and Dan et al. [35] demonstrate how knowledge
of power system topology and the correlation, present in
power system measurement data can be leveraged to provide
effective, cost-efficient solutions for detecting malicious false
data injection, and also to provide insight into the nature of unobservable
attacks. Giani et al. [36] provide further characterization
of unobservable attacks. However, unlike SCPSE, those
efforts only leverage power system measurements except for
[35] which leverages communication infrastructure topology information
as well.
We now discuss related work that is focused on the security of
cyber infrastructure. Cyber-based diagnostics mechanisms try
to estimate the security state of a computer network [37]. Bothunter
[38] extends ideas from multi-sensor data fusion to probabilistically
correlate triggered alerts generated by intrusion detection
systems (IDSes). The main goal is to identify the set of
compromised hosts [39]; however, in a power grid context, the
goal is the overall safety and reliability of the grid and not security
of individual hosts. Such solutions, as they do not take
the impact on the physical system into account, are thus unable
to provide a complete picture. Ten et al. [40] propose a vulnerability
assessment technique to evaluate the vulnerabilities of
SCADA systems at three levels: system, scenarios, and access
points. By calculating the risk of each asset's compromise, Mohajerani
et al. [41] introduce a method to detect and improve
the vulnerability of power networks against the intrusions and
malicious acts of cyber hackers. [40], [41] both perform in an
offline manner, and hence cannot monitor the system for malicious
activities while it is in its operational mode. Wilken et
al. [42] propose a software fault diagnosis solution that uses
data redundancy to detect faults that have been caused by probabilistic
system failures [43]. Therefore, software crashes that
result from vulnerability exploitations cannot be completely detected
using their proposed approach. For cyber systems, there
have been extensive investigations into intrusion detection techniques
such as anomaly-based [44], signature-based [45], and
(recently) specification-based solutions [46]. However, those
traditional cyber diagnostics solutions ignore the topology and
configuration of the underlying physical power system [47]. In
contrast, our framework leverages the topology and configuration
of the underlying physical power system to validate the outcomes
of traditional IDSes.
For process control networks, Cardenas et al. [48] investigate
an intrusion detection technique in which the attack's final target
is assumed to be given. That assumption could be exploited by
attackers to further damage the process control network by targeting
other critical goals. SCPSE, while generating the attack
graph, considers all possible attack paths, even those that do not
end up in critical assets, e.g., an internal Web server.
In summary, unlike previous techniques, SCPSE leverages
information from the cyber network (control network topology,
access policies, and sensory reports) along with information
from the power system (network model and measurements) to
detect false data and provide an improved estimate of the cyberphysical
state.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we introduced SCPSE, a cyber-physical security
state estimation framework that can identify malicious activities
and accurately estimate the cyber-physical security state
of a power grid. SCPSE exploits available offline information,
like power network access policies, to create a comprehensive
model of the cyber-physical system. During operational mode,
SCPSE makes use of the available online information from both
the cyber security sensors and the power measurements and efficiently
fuses that information using the generated system model.
The experimental results show that SCPSE can efficiently estimate
the cyber security state of a system, identify malicious
measurement corruptions, and, consequently, calculate a correct
state estimate of the underlying system.
