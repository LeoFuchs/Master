Abstract-The resilience of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition
(SCADA) systems for electric power networks for certain
cyber-attacks is considered. We analyze the vulnerability of
the measurement system to false data attack on communicated
measurements. The vulnerability analysis problem is shown to be
NP-hard, meaning that unless P = N P there is no polynomial
time algorithm to analyze the vulnerability of the system. Nevertheless,
we identify situations, such as the full measurement case,
where the analysis problem can be solved efficiently. In such cases,
we show indeed that the problem can be cast as a generalization of
the minimum cut problem involving nodes with possibly nonzero
costs. We further show that it can be reformulated as a standard
minimum cut problem (without node costs) on a modified graph
of proportional size. An important consequence of this result is
that our approach provides the first exact efficient algorithm for
the vulnerability analysis problem under the full measurement
assumption. Furthermore, our approach also provides an efficient
heuristic algorithm for the general NP-hard problem. Our results
are illustrated by numerical studies on benchmark systems including
the IEEE 118-bus system.

in the electric power transmission grid, SCADA systems collect
measurements through remote terminal units (RTUs) and send
them to the state estimator to estimate the system states. The
estimated states are used for subsequent operations such as
system health monitoring and control. Any malfunctioning of
these operations can lead to significant social and economical
consequences such as the northeast US blackout of 2003 [1].
The technology and the use of the SCADA systems have
evolved a lot since they were introduced. The SCADA systems
now are interconnected to office LANs, and through them they
are connected to the Internet. Hence, today there are more
access points to the SCADA systems, and also more functionalities
to tamper with. For example, the RTUs can be subjected
to denial-of-service attacks. The communicated data can be
subjected to false data attacks. Furthermore, the SCADA master
itself can be attacked. In the context of secured cyber-physical
systems in general, [2], [3] have considered denial-of-servicelike
attacks and their impact. Reference [4] has studied replay
attacks on the sensor measurements and [5], [6] have considered
false data attacks. This paper investigates the cyber security
issues related to false data attacks with the special focus on the
measurement systems of power networks. The negative effects
of false data attacks on SCADA systems have been exemplified
by malware such as Stuxnet and Duqu. False data attacks have
received a lot of attention in the literature (e.g., [7]-[14]).
Reference [7] was the first to point out that a coordinated
intentional data attack can be staged without being detected
by the state estimation bad data detection (BDD) algorithm,
a standard part of today's SCADA/EMS system. References
[7]-[9], [11]-[14] investigate the construction problem for such
“unobservable” data attack, especially the sparse ones involving
relatively few meters to compromise, under various assumptions
of the network (e.g., DC power flow model [15], [16]).
In particular, [7] poses the attack construction problem as a
cardinality minimization problem to find the sparsest attack
including a given set of target measurements. References [8],
[9], [12] set up similar optimization problems for the sparsest
attack including a given measurement. References [11], [14]
seek the sparsest nonzero attack and [13] finds the sparsest attack
including exactly two injection measurements and possibly
more line power flow measurements, under the assumption that
all power injections are measured. The solution information of
the above optimization problems can help network operators
identify the vulnerabilities in the network and strategically
assign protection resources (e.g., encryption of measurements
and secured PMUs) to their best effect (e.g., [9], [10], [14]).

connection to another vital EMS functionality-observability
analysis [15], [16]. In particular, solving the attack construction
problem can also solve an observability analysis problem (this
was explained in [17, Section II-C]). This connection was first
reported in [11], and was utilized in [18] to compute the sparsest
critical p-tuples for some integer p. This is a generalization of
critical measurements and critical sets [15].
To perform the cyber-security analysis in a timely manner,
it is important to solve the data attack construction problem
efficiently. This effort has been discussed, for instance, in
[7]-[9], [11]-[14], [17]. The efficient solution to the attack
construction problem in [8] is the focus of this paper. The
matching pursuit method [19] employed in [7] and the basis
pursuit method [20] (l1 relaxation and its weighted variant)
employed in [14] are common efficient (i.e., polynomial time)
approaches to obtain suboptimal solutions to the attack construction
problem. However, these methods do not guarantee
exact optimal solutions, and they might not be sufficiently
accurate. For instance, [12] describes a naive application of
basis pursuit and its consequences. While [11], [14] provide
polynomial time solution procedures for their respective attack
construction problems, the problems therein are different from
the one in this paper in that the considered problem in this paper
is not a special case of the ones in [11], [14]. In particular,
in [11] the attack vector contains at least one nonzero entry.
However, this nonzero entry cannot be given a priori. This
means that the problem considered in this paper is more general
than the one in [11]. Reference [14] needs to restrict the number
of nonzero injection measurements attacked, while there is no
such constraint in the problem considered in this paper.
Other relevant previous work include [12], [17], [18], which
also consider the data attack construction problem in this paper.
In [12], [18] the attack construction problem is formulated
as a graph generalized minimum cut problem (to be defined
in Section IV-C). However, it is not known in [12], [18]
whether the generalized minimum cut problem can be solved
efficiently (i.e., in polynomial time) or not. Indeed, [12], [18]
only provide approximate solutions. Instead, the current work
establishes that the generalized minimum cut problem is indeed
exactly solvable in polynomial time. This work establishes the
result by constructing a practical polynomial time algorithm.
Regarding [17], one of the main distinctions is that [17] makes
an assumption that no bus injections are metered. The current
result requires a different assumption that the network is fully
measured as in [13] (i.e., all bus injections and line power
flows are metered). In addition, [17] considers a more general
case where the constraint matrix is totally unimodular, whereas
the focus of the current paper is a graph problem. The setup
considered by this paper is specific to network applications and
thus it enables a more efficient solution algorithm. Finally, note
that the notion of minimum cut problem has been explored also
in other power network applications (e.g., [21], [22]).
Outline: In the next section, we present the optimization
problem of interest, namely the security index problem, and discuss
its applications. Then Sections III-V present the technical
contributions of this paper, focusing on a specialized version
of the security index problem defined in (8) in the end of
Section II-B. In Section III the complexity of the security index
problem is analyzed. We show that the security index problem is
NP-hard in general, but in Section IV we demonstrate that under
some realistic assumptions it can be restated as a generalized
minimum cut (Min Cut) problem. In Section V we show that
the generalized Min Cut problem can be solved efficiently,
by reformulating it as a classical Min Cut problem. The
specialized version considered in Sections III-V turns out to be
not restrictive, as far as the application of the proposed results is
concerned. This will be explained in Section VI. In Section VII
a simple numerical example is first presented to illustrate that
the proposed solution correctly solves the generalized Min
Cut problem. Then the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed
solution to the security index problem are demonstrated through
a case study with large-scale benchmark systems. We also
demonstrate that our method provides an efficient and high
quality approximate solution to the general problem security
index problem which is NP-hard.
II. THE SECURITY INDEX PROBLEM
In Section II-A, the mathematical model of the power networks
considered is first described. Then in Section II-B, the
security index of power networks is defined.
A. Power Network Model and State Estimation
A power network is modeled as a graph with n + 1 nodes
and m edges. The nodes and edges model the buses and
transmission lines in the power network, respectively. In the
present text, the terms node and bus are used interchangeably,
and the same is true for edges and transmission lines (or simply
lines). The topology of the graph is described by a directed
incidence matrix A ∈ R(n+1)×m, in which the directions along
the edges are arbitrarily specified [12]. The physical property
of the network is described by a nonsingular diagonal matrix
D ∈ Rm×m, whose nonzero entries are the reciprocals of the
reactance of the transmission lines. In general, the reactance is
positive (i.e., inductive) and hence the matrix D is assumed to
be positive definite throughout this paper.
In the sequel, the set of all nodes and the set of all directed
edges of the power network graph are denoted V 0 and E0,
respectively. The edge directions are consistent with those in
A. An element of V 0 is denoted by vi ∈ V 0, and an element of
E0 is denoted by (vi, vj ) ∈ E0 for vi ∈ V 0 and vj ∈ V 0. The
set of all neighbors of vi is denoted by N (vi). A node vj is a
neighbor of vi if either (vi, vj ) ∈ E0 or (vj , vi) ∈ E0.
The states of the network include bus voltage phase angles
and bus voltage magnitudes, the latter of which are typically assumed
to be constant (one in the per unit system). Therefore, the
network states can be captured in a vector θ ∈ [0, 2π)n+1. The
state estimator estimates θ based on the measurements obtained
from the network. In reality the model relating the states and the
measurements is nonlinear. However, for state estimation data
attack analysis [7]-[14], [17] (and more traditionally bad data
analysis [15], [16], [23]) it suffices to consider the DC power
flow model [15], [16]. In addition, the DC power flow model
is accurate for security analysis even if control actions taken
by the control center are considered. Because of the slow time
where W is a given positive-definite diagonal matrix, whose
nonzero entries are typically the reciprocals of the variances
of the measurement noise. The state estimate θˆ = [0 θˆ2T:]T is
subsequently fed to other vital SCADA functionalities such as
optimal power flow (OPF) calculation and contingency analysis
(CA). Therefore, the accuracy and reliability of θˆ is of
paramount concern.
Notice that in addition to the alternating current (AC) electric
power transmission/distribution networks mentioned in this
paper, the DC power flow measurement model in (1) can in
fact characterize the measurement system of any potential flow
network in steady state under certain assumptions, i.e., the
potential flows depend linearly on potential differences and the
flow conservation law is satisfied. For example, model (1) can
describe water distribution networks where the potentials are
water pressures and the potential flows (i.e., edge flows) are
along distribution pipes where the Hagen-Poiseuille model is
valid [25]. Alternatively, model (1) can describe high-voltage
direct current (HVDC) electric power transmission networks
where the potentials are voltages and the edge flows are DC
flows on transmission lines. The edge flows are linearly related
to the voltage differences between the end nodes of transmission
lines through the Ohm's law.

In (1), Δz can either be a vector of random error or intentional
additive data attack (e.g., [7]), and P1, P2, and P3 consist of
subsets of rows of identity matrices of appropriate dimensions,
indicating which measurements are actually taken. The term
P1DAT θ contains line power flow measurements, measured
at the outgoing ends of the lines. Similarly, −P2DAT θ contains
the line power flow measurements at the incoming ends of
the lines. The term P3ADAT θ contains bus power injection
measurements, one entry for each measured bus. For example,
P1 has as many rows as the number of flow measurements at
outgoing ends of the lines, and each column of P1 corresponds
to an edge in the network. See Fig. 1 for an illustration of the
matrices in (1).
Measurement redundancy is a common practice in power networks
[15], [16]. Therefore, it is assumed in this paper that the
measurement system described by H is observable-meaning
that if any column of H is removed the remaining submatrix
still has rank n [15], [16]. Note that H cannot have rank n + 1
since the sum of all columns of H is always a zero column
vector (a property of any incidence matrix A). In the practice
of power system state estimation, it is customary to designate
an arbitrary node as the reference and set the corresponding
entry of θ to zero. Without loss of generality, it is assumed
that the first entry of θ is zero (i.e., θ(1) = 0) and denote θ2: as
the rest of the entries of θ. For convenience, let H2: denote H
with the first column removed. By definition, Hθ = H2:θ2: and
H2: has full column rank (= n) since H is observable. Given
measurements z, the estimate of the network states is typically
determined via the least squares approach [15], [16]:
ˆ
θ2: =
H2T: W H2: −1 H2T: W z
Fig. 1. Simple power network with three buses and two transmission lines.
With the assumed directions of the transmission lines, the incidence matrix A,
according to MATLAB notation, is A = [1, 0; −1, 1; 0, −1]. The matrix D is
D = [1/x12, 0; 0, 1/x23], where x12 and x23 are the reactances of lines (1,2)
and (2,3), respectively. The black squares indicate the meters. The measurement
selection matrices are P1 = [1, 0], P2 = [0, 1], and P3 = [0, 1, 0].
scale at which today's control centers operate, it is accurate to
assume the power system reaches steady state after each new
control decision the control center makes. For instance, the
sampling period of the control center is at least 10 s, whereas
power system transients die out in less than a second (assuming
of course it is stable). Reference [24] analyzes how the control
center would react under the influence of unobservable data
attack.
In the DC power flow model the measurement vector, denoted
as z, is related to θ by
z = Hθ + Δz,

To detect possible faults or data attacks in the measurements
z, the BDD test is commonly performed [15], [16]. In a typical
strategy, if the norm of the residual
residual =Δ z − H2:θˆ2 = I − H2: H2T: W H2: −1 H2T: W
is too big, then the BDD alarm is triggered. The BDD test is in
general sufficient to detect the presence of a random error Δz
[15], [16]. However, in face of a coordinated malicious attack
the BDD test can fail. In particular, in [7] it was reported that
an attack of the form
Δz = HΔθ
for an arbitrary Δθ ∈ Rn+1 would result in a zero residual in
(3) since HΔθ = H2:Δθ2: for some Δθ2: ∈ Rn. Data attack
in the form of (4) is unobservable from the BDD perspective,
and this was also experimentally verified in [26] in a realistic
SCADA system testbed. Since [7], there has been a significant
amount of literature studying the unobservable attack in (4)
and its consequences to state estimation data integrity (e.g.,
[8]-[11], [13], [14]). In particular, [8] introduced the notion of
security index αk for a measurement k as the optimal objective
value of the following cardinality minimization problem:
Δ
αk =
min
Δθ∈Rn+1
subject to
card(HΔθ)
H(k, :)Δθ = 1
(2)
where card(·) denotes the cardinality of its argument, k is
the label of the measurement for which the security index αk
is computed, and H(k, :) denotes the kth row of H. αk is
the minimum number of measurements an attacker needs to
compromise in order to attack measurement k without being
detected. In particular, a small αk implies that measurement
k is relatively easy to compromise in an unobservable attack.
As a result, the knowledge of the security indices for all measurements
allows the network operator to pinpoint the security
vulnerabilities of the network, and to better protect the network
with limited resource. For example, [9] proposed a method
to optimally assign limited encryption protection resources
to improve the security of the network based on its security
indices.
It should be emphasized that the security index defined in
(5) can provide a security assessment that the standard power
network BDD procedure [15], [16] might not be able to provide.
As a concrete example [8], consider the simple network whose
H2: matrix is

where e¯ ∈ {1, 2, . . . , m} is given. The restriction introduced in
(8) is that it can only enforce constraints on edge flows but
not on node injections as directly allowed by (5). We will see
however in Section VI that all results obtained for (8) can be
extended to the general case in (5).

Consider a variant of (5) where k is not fixed (i.e., one
wishes to minimize card(HΔθ) under the constraint that at
⎛ −1 −1 0 ⎞ least one entry of HΔθ is nonzero). This variant of (5) is

0 −1 0 spark of F is defined as the minimum number of columns
of F which are linearly dependent [28]. It is established that
From (2), the “hat matrix” [15], [16], denoted K is defined computing the spark of a general matrix F is NP-hard [29],

Fig. 2. Representation of a part of the construction of the proof of Theorem 1,
including the reference values of Δθ and one clause Cj. Edges are represented
by dashed line when they are measured and continuous lines when they are
floating. Nodes are represented by squares when they are measured and circles
when they are floating. If card(HΔθ) = n + 1, the rest of the construction
ensures that Δθ takes only values 1 and 0 for the xi, and that all entries of
HΔθ other than those corresponding to the nodes xi must be zero. As a result,
a measured (dashed) edge transmits no current and enforces equality between
the values of the nodes to which it is incident, and measured (circle) nodes
enforce that the sum of the currents on the incident edges should be 0. These
constraints can only be satisfied if Δθcj = 1/3, and if exactly one of the nodes
involved in each clause is at 1 while the others are at 0.
in (8), corresponds to this edge, so that there must hold Δθ1 Δθ0
= 1 for any solution of the problem. Since HΔθ is not
modified when adding a constant to all entries of Δθ, we
assume without loss of generality that Δθ1 = 1 and Δθ0 = 0.
The goal of the first part of our construction is to represent
the n variables. For every i = 1, . . . , n, we define a floating
node xi, and we connect it to both 1 and 0 by measured
edges. Observe that the two entries of HΔθ corresponding to
these two edges are 1 − Δθxi and 0 − Δθxi , which cannot be
simultaneously 0. Moreover, one of them is equal to zero if and
only if Δθxi is either 0 or 1.
Taking into account the fact the entry of HΔθ corresponding
to the edge (1,0) is by definition 1, it follows that card(HΔθ) ≥
n + 1 for any Δθ, independently of the rest of the construction.
Moreover, card(HΔθ) = n + 1 only if Δθxi ∈ {0, 1} for
every i, and if the entries of HΔθ corresponding to all the
measured edges and nodes introduced in the sequel are 0. The
remainder of the construction, represented in Fig. 2, is designed
to ensure that all these entries can be 0 only if the (binary)
values Δθxi solves the initial instance of the positive one-inthree
3SAT problem.
We first generate a reference value at 1/3: We define two
measured nodes indexed by 2/3 and 1/3. We then add floating
edges (1, 2/3), (2/3, 1/3), (1/3, 0). Besides, we define for every
clause j = 1, . . . , M a measured clause node cj connected to
1/3 by a measured edge.
The entries of HΔθ corresponding to the edges between 1/3
and cj are Δθ1/3 − Δθcj . We have seen that, if card(HΔθ) =
n + 1, all these entries must be equal to 0, so that Δθcj =
Δθ1/3 for every j. Observe then that the entry of HΔθ corresponding
to 1/3 is in that case
M
j=1
Δθ 2 + Δθ0 +

Δθcj − (2 + M )Δθ 1 = Δθ 2 + 0 − 2Δθ 1
3 3 3
while the entry corresponding to 2/3 is 1 + Δθ1/3 − 2Δθ2/3.
These two entries are thus equal to zero if and only if Δθ2/3 =
2/3 and Δθcj = Δθ1/3 = 1/3 for every j, as intended.
We now represent the clauses. For each j, we connect the
(measured) clause node cj to the (floating) nodes xαj , xβj , and
xγj of the three variables involved in the clause by floating
edges. The entry of HΔθ corresponding to each clause node
cj is then
Δθxαj + Δθxβj + Δθxγj − 3Δθcj
= Δθxαj + Δθxβj + Δθxγj − 1.
Remembering that Δθxi is either 1 or 0 for any i, this latter
expression can be zero only if exactly one among Δθxαj ,
Δθxβj , and Δθxγj is 1. If that is the case, setting x˜i = Δθxi
for every i yields a vector x that solves the instance of positive
one-in-three 3SAT.
We have thus shown that there exists a Δθ for which
card(HΔθ) = n + 1 only if the Δθxi are binary and the binary
vector x˜ obtained by setting x˜i = Δθxi solves the instance of
positive one-in-three 3SAT. Conversely, one can verify that if
a binary vector x˜ solves the instance of the one-in-three 3SAT
problem, then setting Δθxi = x˜i for every i, Δθcj = Δθ1/3 =
1/3 for every j and Δθ2/3 = 2/3 yields a cost card(HΔθ) =
n + 1. The latter cost can thus be obtained if and only if the
initial positive one-in-three 3SAT problem is achievable. This
achieves the proof because our construction clearly takes an
amount of time that grows polynomially with the size of the
instance C, and unless P = N P there is no polynomial time
algorithm that solves the positive one-in-three 3SAT [31].
Remark 1: (5) is also NP-hard since (8) is a special case
of (5).
IV. TRACTABLE CASES OF SECURITY INDEX PROBLEM
In Section IV-A, we show that, under the full measurement
assumption, the security index problem can be solved by solving
its restriction where decision variables take binary values.
Section IV-B presents the proof of the statement which implies
our finding in Section IV-A. Section IV-B also discusses the
relationship between the security index problem and its binary
restriction defined in Section IV-A. Section IV-C describes
the consequences of Section IV-A and B, explaining how the
security index problem can be reformulated as a generalized
minimum cut problem with node costs, a graph problem whose
efficient solution will be discussed in Section V.
A. The Security Index Problem Under Full
Measurement Assumption
Even though in general the security index problem in (8) is
NP-hard for H defined in (1), there exist interesting specializations
that are solvable in polynomial time. One such case
is the full measurement situation where P1 = I, P2 = I, and
P3 = I. In [12], [13], the full measurement assumption is also
considered, motivated by the situations where all power flows
and injections are measured in future smart grid applications.
The polynomial time complexity of (8) under the full measurement
assumption can be established in three steps. Firstly, it can
be shown that problem (8) can be solved by solving a restriction
where the decision vector Δθ is a binary vector. Secondly, in
HENDRICKX et al.: EFFICIENT COMPUTATIONS OF A SECURITY INDEX FOR FALSE DATA ATTACKS IN POWER NETWORKS
3199
Section IV-C it will be shown that the binary restriction of
(8) can be expressed in a generalized Min Cut problem with
node costs. Finally, this generalized Min Cut problem can be
shown to be solvable in polynomial time. This is to be explained
in Section V.
The first step is formalized in the following statement, whose
preliminary version appeared in [12].
Proposition 1: Let H in (1) satisfy the full measurement
assumption that P1 = I, P2 = I, and P3 = I. Consider the
restriction of problem (8) with 0-1 binary decision vector
minimize
Δθ∈{0,1}n+1
subject to
card(HΔθ)
A(:, e¯)T Δθ = 0.
(9)
It holds that every optimal solution of (9) is an optimal solution
of (8) (i.e., the problem with the same formulation except that
Δθ is not restricted to binary values).
Proof: Proposition 1 is a corollary of the more general
Theorem 2 to be described in Section IV-B.
Remmark 2: Since there cannot be any all-zero column
in any incidence matrix A, problem (8) and (9) are always
feasible. Proposition 1 states that, under the full measurement
assumption, an optimal solution of (8) can always be obtained
by solving (9). The later problem will be shown to be solvable
in polynomial time.
B. The Security Index Problem With Binary Decision Vector
This subsection establishes Proposition 1, providing the first
step in the efficient solution method for problem (8) under the
full measurement assumption. Recall that V 0 and E0 denote
the sets of all nodes and all edges of the power network graph,
respectively. In the sequel, let pi ≥ 0 represent the cost of
attacking the injection measurement at bus vi ∈ V 0, and ce ≥ 0
represent the cost of attacking the power flow measurements at
both ends of an edge e ∈ E0 (it is impossible to modify the
measurement at one end without affecting the one at the other
end). Problem (8) can be generalized to model the situation
where tampering with certain measurements may be more
expensive than with some others:
minimize
Δθ∈Rn+1
subject to
cT g(DAT Δθ) + pT g(ADAT Δθ)
A(:, e¯)T Δθ = 0
where p ∈ Rn+1 is the node measurement attack cost vector
+
whose entries are indexed by pi for each vi ∈ V 0, and c ∈ Rm
+
is the edge measurement attack cost vector whose entries are
indexed by ce for each e ∈ E0. Similar to the change from (8)
to (10), the binary variable version in (9) is generalized to
minimize
Δθ∈{0,1}n+1
subject to
cT g(DAT Δθ) + pT g(ADAT Δθ)
A(:, e¯)T Δθ = 0.
(10)
(11)
In (10) and (11), g is a vector-valued indicator function such
that for any vector x, gi(x) = 1 if xi = 0 and gi(x) = 0 otherwise.
An instance of (10) or (11) can be reduced, respectively,
to an instance of (8) or (9) if the following rules are applied:
In (10) or (11), for each vi ∈ V 0, let pi ∈ {0, 1} be the total
number of nonzero entry in the column of P3 corresponding to
vi (P3 defined in H in (1)). For each e ∈ E0, set ce ∈ {0, 1, 2}
to be the total number of nonzero entries in the column of
[P1T P2T ]T corresponding to e. Then, (8) or (9) is recovered.
The following theorem characterizes the relationship between
the security index problem in (8) and its binary restriction in
(9) by studying their respective generalizations of (10) and (11)
for arbitrary nonnegative vectors c and p.
Theorem 2: Let Jc and Jb, respectively, denote the optimal
objective values of (10) and of its restriction to binary variables
(11) with A and D defined in (1), c ∈ R+m, p ∈ Rn+1, and e¯ ∈
+
{1, 2, . . . , m} given. Then
0 ≤ Jb − Jc ≤
vi∈V 0
max 0, me→avxi{pi − ce}
(12)
where the symbol e → vi denotes that e ∈ E0 is incident to
node vi (i.e., ∃vj ∈ V 0 such that e connects vi and vj ).
Proof: The proof requires the following notations: In (10)
and (11), the vector DAT Δθ has as many rows as the number
of edges in the power network graph (with node set V 0 and
edge set E0). Each row of DAT Δθ corresponds to some
edge e ∈ E0. We denote by [DAT Δθ]e the row of DAT Δθ
corresponding to edge e. Similarly, the vector ADAT Δθ has as
many rows as the number of nodes, and each row corresponds
to some node v ∈ V 0. We denote by [ADAT Δθ]v the row
of ADAT Δθ corresponding to node v. With a slight abuse
of notation, the symbol g([DAT Δθ]e) denotes the entry of
g(DAT Δθ) corresponding to e. In addition, g([ADAT Δθ]v)
corresponds to the entry of g(ADAT Δθ) associated with node
v. We remind the reader that N (vi) denote the set of all nodes
neighboring vi.
First note that both (10) and (11) are always feasible
with finite optimal objective values attained by some optimal
solutions. In addition, 0 ≤ Jb − Jc holds because (11) is
a restriction of (10). To show the upper bound in (12) the
main idea is that for each feasible solution Δθ of (10) it
is possible to construct a feasible solution Δφ of (11), such
that the objective value difference is bounded from above by
vi∈V 0 max{0, maxe→vi {pi − ce}}. The construction is as
follows. Let Δθ be a feasible solution of (10), and let Δθi be its
entry corresponding to node vi ∈ V 0. Since Δθ is feasible, the
constraint A(:, e¯)T Δθ = 0 implies that there exist two nodes
denoted vs and vt with e¯ corresponding to either (vs, vt) or
(vt, vs) such that Δθs = Δθt. Without loss of generality, it is
assumed that Δθs > Δθt. Define Δφ ∈ {0, 1}n+1 by
Δφi =
1 if Δθi > Δθt
0 if Δθi ≤ Δθt
∀ vi ∈ V 0.
(13)
Note that Δφ is feasible to (11), since Δφs = Δφt by construction.
Also notice that for any two nodes vi and vj if Δθi = Δθj
then Δφi = Δφj . Hence, in the objective functions of (10) and
(11) it holds that
ceg [DAT Δθ]e ≥ ceg [DAT Δφ]e ,
∀ e ∈ E0.
(14)
3200
IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL, VOL. 59, NO. 12, DECEMBER 2014
In other words, for each edge the contribution to the objective
function with the new solution Δφ is smaller than or equal
to that with the initial one Δθ. To finish the proof, the objective
function contributions due to the node injections, i.e.,
the terms pT g(ADAT Δθ) and pT g(ADAT Δφ), need to be
investigated. We will see that for some nodes the difference
of nodal objective contributions between the solutions Δφ and
Δθ is positive, and in fact equal to pi for each such node
vi. On the other hand we will show that to each of these
nodes one can associate a distinct incident edge e˜(i) for which
the corresponding difference of edge objective contributions is
−ce˜(i). To investigate the the aforementioned cost change, let
Vb ⊂ V 0 be the set of nodes defined by
vi ∈ Vb ⇐⇒ g [ADAT Δθ]vi
= 0, g [ADAT Δφ]vi
In essence, Vb encompasses all potential causes for Jb >
Jc. Consider vi ∈ Vb, since g([ADAT Δφ]vi ) = 1, there exists
vk ∈ N (vi) such that Δφk = Δφi, and therefore Δθk =
Δθi (by the definition (13)). Consequently, the fact that
g([ADAT Δθ]vi ) = 0 (i.e., vj∈N(vi) Di,j (Δθj − Δθi) = 0
with Di,j > 0 denoting the diagonal entry of D associated
with the edge linking vi and vj ) implies that (i) there exists
vi+ = argmaxvk∈N(vi){Δθk} such that Δθi+ > Δθi; and
(ii) there exists vi− = argminvk∈N(vi){Δθk} such that
Δθi− < Δθi. For each node vi ∈ Vb, we then define e˜(i) ∈ E0
as the edge linking vi to vi+ if Δθi > Δθt, and as the edge
linking vi to vi− if Δθi ≤ Δθt. It follows from the definition
of vi+ and vi− that in both cases, e˜(i) connects vi with a node
whose corresponding entry in Δθ is more distant from Δθt than
Δθi is. As a result, there holds
vi = vj ⇒ e˜(i) = e˜(j),
∀ vi, vj ∈ Vb.
We now prove that for every vi ∈ Vb,
g [DAT Δθ]e˜(i) = 1,
g [DAT Δφ]e˜(i) = 0.
We suppose first that Δθi > Δθt, and thus that e˜(i) connects
vi to vi+ . The equalities of (17) can in that case be written
Δθi+ = Δθi and Δφi+ = Δφi. By definition of vi+ , there
holds Δθi+ > Δθi > Δθt, which directly proves the first one,
and implies moreover that Δφi+ = Δφi = 1 thanks to the
definition of Δφ, so that the second equality also holds. A
symmetric reasoning applies if Δθi ≤ Δθt.
We can now deduce the second inequality of (12): For all
feasible solutions Δθ of (10), it holds that
= 1.
(15)
(16)
(17)
Jb − cT g(DAT Δθ) − pT g(ADAT Δθ)
≤ cT g(DAT Δφ) + pT g(ADAT Δφ)
− cT g(DAT Δθ) − pT g(ADAT Δθ)
(18)
because Δφ is a feasible solution of (11) and Jb is the optimal
objective value of (11). The second member of the inequality
(18) can be rewritten as
vi∈Vb
pi g [ADAT Δφ]vi − g [ADAT Δθ]vi
+
+
+
vi∈V 0\Vb
vi∈Vb
e∈E0
e=e˜(i), ∀ vi∈Vb
pi g [ADAT Δφ]vi − g [ADAT Δθ]vi
ce˜(i) g [DAT Δφ]e˜(i) − g [DAT Δθ]e˜(i)
ce g [DAT Δφ]e − g [DAT Δθ]e
.
(19)
It follows indeed from (16) that every edge e ∈ E0 appears
exactly once in the summation (19), either in the third or
the fourth term, so that the sum of these two terms equals
cT g(DAT Δφ) − cT g(DAT Δθ). The definition of Vb (15) implies
that the first term of (19) is equal to vi∈Vb pi, and that
the second is zero. Equation (17) implies then that the third term
is equal to vi∈Vb ce˜(i). Finally, (14) implies the nonpositivity
of the fourth term. We have thus
Jb − cT g(DAT Δθ) − pT g(ADAT Δθ)
≤
≤
≤
vi∈Vb
vi∈Vb
vi∈V 0
pi − ce˜(i)
me→avxi{pi − ce}
max 0, me→avxi{pi − ce} .
(20)
Finally, since (20) applies to all feasible solutions Δθ of (10),
the upper bound in (12) follows.
Remark 3: The full measurement assumption in
Proposition 1 corresponds to a special case in Theorem 2
where ce = 2 for all e ∈ E0 and pi = 1 for all vi ∈ V 0. The
inequalities in (12) imply Proposition 1.
Remark 4: Theorem 2 suggests other situations where (8)
and (9) are equivalent. One example is when there is a meter on
each edge and there is at most one meter in each node. In this
case, [P1T P2T ]T does not have a zero column and P3 consists
of subsets of rows of an identity matrix. This corresponds to
ce = 1 for all e and pi ≤ 1 for all i, j in Theorem 2. Another
situation suggesting equivalence is as follows: if an edge is not
metered, then its two terminal nodes are not metered either. This
corresponds to a case when pi ≤ mine→vi ce for all vi ∈ V 0,
implying that maxe→vi {pi − ce} = 0.
Remark 5: Without the full measurement assumption or
conditions such as those described in Remark 4, solving (9)
can lead to an approximate solution to (8) with an error upper
bound provided by (12). This error bound, however, is rather
conservative since the summation is over all nodes vi ∈ V 0. As
developed in the proof, the summation is in fact over a subset
Vb of V 0. However, in general it is difficult to characterize the
Vb which leads to the tightest possible upper bound without first
solving (8) to optimality.
Remark 6: The argument in Remark 4 provides the basis
for obtaining a lower bound for the optimal objective value of
(8) even without the full measurement assumption: Construct a
modified measurement matrix H˜ corresponding to a modified
HENDRICKX et al.: EFFICIENT COMPUTATIONS OF A SECURITY INDEX FOR FALSE DATA ATTACKS IN POWER NETWORKS
3201
measurement system in which each edge has exactly the same
number of meters as in the original measurement system.
However, the set of node meters in the modified measurement
system is a subset of the node meter set in the original case.
All node meters in nodes incident to any unmetered edge are
removed in the modified setup. Solving (8) with H˜ leads to
a lower bound of the optimal objective value of (8) with H
because the objective function in the former case is always less
than or equal to that of the later case. In addition, by Remark 4
solving (9) with H˜ leads to the exact optimal objective value of
(8) with H˜ . Therefore, solving (9) with H˜ leads to an efficient
approach to obtain a lower bound for the original problem of
(8) with H, provided that (9) with H˜ can be solved efficiently.
C. Reformulating the Security Index Problem into Generalized
Min Cut Problem With Node Costs
The above discussion suggests that the (exact or approximate)
solution to the security index problem is obtained by
solving (11), whose graph interpretation will be the focus of
this subsection. In (11) the choice of 0 or 1 for each entry of
Δθ is a partitioning of the nodes into two parts. The constraint
A(:, e¯)T Δθ = 0 enforces that the two end nodes of edge e¯,
denoted as vs and vt, must be in two different parts of the
partition. In the objective function, the term cT g(DAT Δθ) is
the sum of the edge weights of the edges whose two ends are in
different parts (i.e., edges that are “cut”, in an undirected sense).
In addition, since Δθ has binary entries, a row of ADAT Δθ is
zero if and only if the corresponding node and all its neighbors
are in the same part of the partition (i.e., none of the incident
edges are cut). Therefore, the term pT g(ADAT Δθ) in the
objective function is the sum of the node weights of the nodes
connected to at least one cut edge. In summary, (11) can be
reinterpreted as a generalized minimum cut problem on an
undirected graph (i.e., the original power network graph with
the edge direction ignored). The generalization is due to the
presence of the node weights.
We now define formally the Min Cut with node
costs problem (on any given directed graph) of which (11)
and the standard Min Cut problem are special cases. Let
G(V, E) be a directed graph (we will see that the problem can
be particularized to undirected graphs), where V denotes the
set of nodes {v1, . . . , vn+1}, and E the set of directed edges;
and suppose that a cost cij ≥ 0 is associated to each directed
edge (vi, vj ) and a cost pi ≥ 0 is associated to each node vi.
We designate two special nodes: a source node vs and a sink
node vt. The problem is the following:
Problem 1: The Min Cut with node costs problem.
Find a partition of V , denoted as P = {Ss, St}, such that
Ss, St ⊂ V , Ss ∩ St = ∅, Ss ∪ St = V , s ∈ Ss, t ∈ St which
minimizes the cost
C(P ) =
+
(vi,vj)∈E:vi∈Ss,vj∈St
cij
pi +
vi∈Ss:∃(vi,vj)∈E:vj∈St
vj∈St:∃(vi,vj)∈E:vi∈Ss
pj . (21)
When the node costs are all set to zero (i.e., pi = 0 for all vi ∈
V ), Problem 1 reduces to the standard Min Cut problem (see,
for instance, [32] for more detail). By convention, if vi ∈ Ss,
vj ∈ St, for two nodes vi, vj , we will say that both these nodes,
and the edge (vi, vj ), are in the cut, or that this edge is cut.
Notice that in a directed graph an edge (vi, vj ) is cut if
vi ∈ Ss and vj ∈ St but not in the reverse case, where vi ∈ St
and vj ∈ Ss, and the cost cij is not incurred in that latter case.
This asymmetry disappears however in symmetric graphs, in
which to each edge (vi, vj ) with weight cij corresponds a
symmetric edge (vj , vi) with same weight. For these symmetric
graphs, the cost cij is incurred as soon as vi and vj are not in
the same set. Indeed, exactly one among (vi, vj ) and (vj , vi)
is in the cut in that case. The cost (21) consists then of the
sum of the cij (= cji) over all pairs of nodes vi, vj that are in
different sets, and consists of the sum of the pi over all nodes
that are adjacent to nodes in a different set. Thus, (11) defined
on the power network graph G(V 0, E0) could be modeled by
Problem 1 defined on a symmetric graph G(V, E) if the following
holds: Let V = V 0 with node cost pi for each vi ∈
V . In addition, for each e = (vi, vj ) ∈ V 0 with cost ce let
both (vi, vj ) and (vj , vi) be in E with cost cij = cji = ce. In
addition, by letting cij = cji = 2 for every edge e = (vi, vj )
and pi = 1 for every node, one recovers problem (9) under the
full measurement assumption. We will show in Section V how
to solve Problem 1, and hence the problems in (11), (9), and (8).
V. AN EFFICIENT SOLUTION TO THE GENERALIZED MIN
CUT TYPE SECURITY INDEX PROBLEM
This section presents the efficient solution to the Min Cut
with node costs problem (i.e., Problem 1) introduced in
Section IV-C. The proposed solution method also solves the
security index problem under the full measurement assumption,
since this problem is a special case of the Min Cut with
node costs problem.
A. Construction of an Auxiliary Graph
Consider a directed graph G(V, E), V = {v1, . . . , vn+1}
with a set of nonnegative weights cij ≥ 0, and pi ≥ 0 for each
node vi ∈ V , a source node vs and a sink node vt. We build an
auxiliary graph G˜ using the following algorithm, illustrated in
Fig. 3 on an example:
1) Define the set V˜ = {v˜i, w˜i, z˜i : 1 ≤ i ≤ n + 1} of nodes
of the auxiliary graph.
2) Designate v˜s and v˜t as source and sink nodes respectively.
3) For all 1 ≤ i ≤ n + 1, add the two directed edges (w˜i, v˜i)
and (v˜i, z˜i), both with cost pi.
4) For all 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n + 1 : (vi, vj ) ∈ E
• add the edge (v˜i, v˜j ) with cost cij .
• add the two edges (v˜i, w˜j ) and (z˜i, v˜j ), both with a
cost C > maxi pi.
The intuition behind the construction of G˜ is the following:
Suppose that one wants to cut the edge (v˜i, v˜j ), then one must
also cut at least either (v˜i, z˜i) or (z˜i, v˜j ) (see Fig. 3). Because
the latter has a higher cost C, one will naturally cut (v˜i, z˜i),
incurring a cost pi. Moreover, since that edge does not depend
3202

Fig. 3. Representation of the auxiliary graph G˜ associated to the graph G.
The dotted diagonal edges all have the same weight C > max pi. The vertical
dashed edges linking w˜i to v˜i and v˜i to z˜i have weight pi.
on j, one just needs to cut it (and pay the associated cost) once,
independently of the number of other edges (v˜i, v˜k) that will be
cut. A similar reasoning applies to the path (v˜i, w˜j ) or (w˜j , v˜j ).
Therefore, the cost of a minimum cut on G˜ will consists of the
sum of all cij for all edges (v˜i, v˜j ) in the cut, and of the sum
of all pi for nodes incident to one or several edges (v˜i, v˜j ) or
(v˜j , v˜i) in the cut, i.e., to the cost of the equivalent cut on the
initial graph G, taking the node costs into account.
B. Equivalence With Min Cut on the Auxiliary Graph
We now show formally that solving the standard Min
Cut problem on this weighted graph provides a solution to
Problem 1 on the initial graph, and that a solution is obtained
by directly translating the partition of the v˜i into the equivalent
partition of the vi.
Theorem 3: Consider a graph G(V, E) with a set of weights
cij ≥ 0 for each edge (vi, vj ) ∈ E, and pi ≥ 0 for each node
vi ∈ V , a source node vs and a sink node vt. Let G˜(V˜ , E˜) be
the modified graph obtained from G by the procedure described
above, and the partition V˜ = {S˜s, S˜t} be an optimal solution
of the standard Min Cut problem for G˜. Then the partition
{Ss, St} of V , obtained by letting vi ∈ Ss if and only if v˜i ∈
S˜s, is an optimal solution to Problem 1 on G.
Proof: Let us call respectively c∗ and c˜∗ the optimal cost
of Problem 1 on the graph G and Min Cut problem on the
graph G˜. In the sequel, we always assume that the source and
sink nodes belong to the appropriate set of the partition.
We first prove that c˜∗ ≤ c∗, by showing that for any cut in G
with cost c (i.e., the sum of the costs of the edges and the nodes
in the cut is c), one can build a cut in G˜ whose cost is equal to
c in the following way: For any 1 ≤ i ≤ n + 1,
1) If vi ∈ Ss, and all the out-neighbors of vi are in Ss, put
v˜i, w˜i and z˜i in S˜s.
2) if vi ∈ St, and all the in-neighbors of vi are in St, put v˜i,
w˜i and z˜i in S˜t.
3) if vi ∈ Ss, and at least one out-neighbor of vi is in St, put
v˜i, w˜i in S˜s and z˜i in S˜t.
4) if vi ∈ St, and at least one in-neighbor of vi is in Ss, put
v˜i, z˜i in S˜t and w˜i in S˜s.
One can verify that no edge with cost C is in the cut, and that
an edge (v˜i, v˜j ) is in the cut if and only if the corresponding
edge (vi, vj ) (which has the same weight) is in the initial cut.
Moreover, for every node i, the edge (w˜i, v˜i), of weight pi, will
be in the cut if and only if at least one edge arriving at vi was
in the initial cut. Similarly, the edge (v˜i, z˜i) will be in the cut if
and only if at least one edge leaving vi is in the initial cut. So,
there will be a contribution pi to the total cost if at least an edge
arriving at vi is in the cut or at least one edge leaving vi is in the
cut (note that the two situations cannot happen simultaneously).
As a conclusion, the cost of the cut {Ss, St} in G (counting
the weights of the nodes) is equal to the cost of the cut
{S˜s, S˜t} in G˜.
Consider now an arbitrary cut in G˜, and the corresponding
cut in G obtained by putting vi in Ss if and only if v˜i ∈ S˜s, as
explained in the statement of this theorem. We show that the
cut of G obtained has a cost (taking the vertex costs pi into
account) smaller than or equal to the cost of the initial cut. This
will imply that c˜∗ ≥ c∗.
The cost of this new cut {Ss, St} consists indeed of all the
cij of edges (vi, vj ) in the cut, and all the pi of the nodes at
which arrives, or from which leaves an edge in the cut.
Consider first an edge (vi, vj ) in the cut, i.e., vi ∈ Ss, vj ∈
St. By construction, this implies that v˜i ∈ S˜s and v˜j ∈ S˜t so
that the edge (v˜i, v˜j ) was also in the cut in G˜, incurring a same
cost cij .
Consider now a node vi from which leaves at least one edge
in the cut, incurring thus a cost pi. (A symmetric reasoning
applies if an edge in the cut arrives at vi, and no node has edges
in the cut both leaving from and arriving at it.) Call vj the node
at which arrives that edge. We have thus vi ∈ Ss and vj ∈ St,
and therefore v˜i ∈ S˜s, v˜j ∈ S˜t in G˜. This implies that one edge
of the path consisting of (v˜i, z˜i) and (z˜i, v˜j ) is in the cut. These
edges have respective costs pi and C > pi, so that a cost at least
pi will be incurred by the cut in G˜. Note moreover that none of
these edges will appear when considering other nodes and be
counted more than once.
We have thus shown that to each cost in the cut {Ss, St} for
Problem 1 corresponds a larger or equal cost in {S˜s, S˜t} for the
Min Cut problem, and thus that the former has a smaller cost.
Therefore, if one takes any cut of optimal cost c˜∗ for the Min
Cut problem on G˜, and applies the procedure described in the
theorem, one obtains a cut of G with a smaller or equal cost for
Problem 1. Since we have proved that the optimal cost of the
latter problem is at least c˜∗, this implies that c˜∗ = c∗ and that
the cost obtained is optimal for Problem 1 on G.
There exist many efficient polynomial time algorithms solving
the Min Cut problem exactly when the weights are nonnegative
(e.g., [33], [34]). Theorem 3 implies that the same
algorithms can be used to solve efficiently Problem 1, and
therefore problem (9), and problem (8) in the fully measured
case. Moreover, observe that the size of this new graph G˜ is
proportional to that of G, as it has 3n nodes and 3|E| + 2n
edges. The order of the polynomial measuring the efficiency
of the algorithms remains therefore unchanged. In particular, if
the standard Min Cut problem on the new graph G˜ is solved
using the algorithm in [33] whose complexity is O(n|E| +
n2 log(n)), our algorithm has the same complexity.
It is well known that Min Cut problems are particular cases
of submodular function optimization, and this type of optimization
problems are solvable by polynomial-time algorithms [35].
Since we show that our problem can be recast as a Min Cut
problem, it enjoys the submodularity property. Hence, it could
be solved in polynomial time by classical submodular function
optimization routines. However, our reduction to a Min Cut
formulation allows one to apply better algorithms tailored for
the particular structure of Min Cut problems.
Finally, consider a slight generalization of Problem 1 in
which each node contains two different weights (one for cutting
outgoing edges and the other for cutting incoming edges).
Then with a corresponding modification in the auxiliary graph
construction procedure in Section V-A (in the fourth bullet),
the proposed method can still solve the generalization in polynomial
time.
VI. THE ORIGINAL SECURITY INDEX PROBLEM
TARGETING EDGE AND NODE
The relationship between the original security index problem
in (5), the problem in (8) and its binary restriction in (9)
is summarized as follows: In the case where H(k, :) in (5)
corresponds to the row of P1DAT or −P2DAT , (5) can be
restated as (8) with an appropriate choice of e¯. Consequently,
solving (9) either exactly solves (5) or approximately solves (5)
with an error bound provided by (12), depending on whether
the full measurement assumption or similar ones in Remark 4
are satisfied or not.
Next, consider the case where H(k, :) corresponds to a row
of P3ADAT . The constraint H(k, :)Δθ = 1 means that the
power injection at the target node, denoted vs, is nonzero. This
implies that at least one edge incident to vs should have nonzero
edge flow. Let ei with i = 1, 2, . . . denote the column indices
of A of the incident edges of vs. For any given k, consider the
following instances (parameterized by ei)
J(i22) =Δ Δθm∈Rinn+1
card (HΔθ)
subject to
H(k, :)Δθ = 0
A(:, ei)T Δθ = 0.
(22)
The minimum of J(i22), over all ei, is the optimal objective value
of (5). In addition, consider a relaxation of (22), obtained by
keeping only the constraint A(:, ei)T Δθ = 0:
and its binary restriction
J(i23) =Δ Δθm∈Rinn+1

subject to
A(:, ei)T Δθ = 0

(23) is an instance of (8), and the fact that (23) has one fewer
constraint than (22) implies that

is a large scalar constant defined in the auxiliary graph construction procedure
in Section V-A. The black nodes form the optimal source set (in the auxiliary
graph), and the dotted red edges are cut. The optimal objective value is 8.
On the other hand, (24) is an instance of (9), and
i i
J(24) ≥ J(22),

(26)
because if Δθ ∈ {0, 1}n+1 is feasible to (24), then it is also
feasible to (22) since the injection at vs is nonzero with Δθ ∈
{0, 1}n+1. Notice, however, that a feasible solution of (23) need
not be feasible to (22). Let i be defined such that J(i22) =
mini J(i22). The full measurement assumption or similar ones in
Remark 4 implies that J(i24) = J(i23), since J(i24) = J(i23) holds
for all i. This, together with (25) and (26), suggests that
i i i i
J(22) ≤ J(24) = J(23) ≤ J(22).
This implies that the equalities above hold throughout, and
solving (9) (by solving (24)) indeed solves the original security
index problem in (5) (by solving (22)). On the other hand, if the
full measurement assumption does not hold, then
i i i i
J(22) ≤ J(24) ≤ J(23) + ΔJ ≤ J(22) + ΔJ
where the error upper bound ΔJ can be obtained from (12).
In conclusion, all exact or approximate results pertaining to
the case between (8) and (9) apply to the case between (5)
and (9). As discussed in Remark 5, the above error bound
might be conservative. The approximation quality in practice
will be demonstrated in Section VII containing some numerical
examples on benchmark power networks.

VII. NUMERICAL EXAMPLES
A. Simple Illustrative Example of Problem 1
To illustrate the proposed method, consider an instance of
Problem 1 depicted in Fig. 4. By inspection, the optimal solution
corresponds to the optimal source set Ss = {vs}, with
objective value being 8. Constructing the auxiliary graph as
described in Section V and solving the corresponding standard
Min Cut problem leads to the node partitioning in Fig. 5. In
the auxiliary graph the optimal source set is {vs, w1, w2}, with
the objective value being 8. According to the rule in Theorem 3,
{vs} is the source set returned by the proposed procedure in this
paper. It correctly solves Problem 1.
B. The Security Index Problem on Benchmark Systems
To demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed
solution, the security index problem for two benchmark
systems is considered (IEEE 118-bus [36] and Polish 2383-bus
[37]). See Fig. 6 for an illustration of the 118-bus system.
First, the full measurement case is considered. The security
index problem in (5) is solved for each measurement, using
the proposed solution and the methods from [12], [18]. The
proposed method is guaranteed to provide the exact optimal
solutions, as explained earlier in the paper. Both for the 118-bus
and 2383-bus cases, the methods from [12], [18] are experimentally
found to provide the exact solutions (though this is not
guaranteed theoretically). The computation times for the three
methods are listed in Table I, indicating that the methods have
similar efficiency. The guarantee of optimality provided by our
approach is obtained at no additional computational cost. The
computation was performed on a PC with 2.4 GHz CPU and
2 GB of RAM. The minimum cut problems are solved using
the MATLAB Boost Graph Library [38], [39].
Next, (5) is considered when the full measurement assumption
is removed. That is, the matrices P1, P2, and P3 in
(1) need not be identities. In this test, the 118-bus system is
considered. In the measurement system about 50% of power

MEASUREMENT CASE FOR THE IEEE 118-BUS AND
POLISH 2383-BUS BENCHMARKS
injections and power flows are measured. The measurements
are chosen randomly (uniform over all possible measurements),
and the measurement system is verified to be observable (i.e.,
the corresponding H2: has full column rank (= n)). Since (5)
is NP-hard in general, no efficient solution algorithm has been
known. Enumerative algorithms include, for instance, enumeration
on the support of HΔθ, finding the maximum feasible
subsystem for an appropriately constructed system of infeasible
inequalities [40], and the big M method to be described. The
authors' implementations of the first two methods turn out to
be too inefficient for the applications concerned. Therefore, the
big M method is used, which sets up and solves the following
optimization problem:
minimize
Δθ,y
subject to
j
y(j)
HΔθ ≤ M y
−HΔθ ≤ M y
H(k, :)Δθ = 1
y(j) ∈ {0, 1}
∀ j.
(27)
In (27), M is a user-defined constant. If M ≥ HΔθ ∞ for
at least one optimal solution Δθ of (5), then (27) provides
the exact solution to (5). Otherwise, solving (27) yields a
suboptimal solution, optimal among all solutions Δθ such that
HΔθ ∞ ≤ M . In principle a sufficiently large M can be
found to ensure that the big M method indeed provides the
optimal solution to (5) [41]. However, this choice of M is
typically too large to be practical. In the numerical example

in this section, M is simply chosen to be 104. (27) can be
solved as a mixed integer linear program [32] using solvers
such as CPLEX [42]. The solutions by the big M method
are treated as references for accuracy for the rest of the case
study. Fig. 7 shows the (big M ) security indices for all chosen
measurements.
Alternatively, as described in Section VI a suboptimal solution
to (5) can be obtained by solving (9) exactly using
the proposed method in Section V (see Remark 5 for detail)
or the ones from [12], [18]. As explained earlier, (9) can be
formulated as Problem 1 with pi = 1 if and only if the injection
measurement at bus vi is taken and cij = cji ∈ {0, 1, 2}
being the total number of line power flow meters on the line
connecting buses vi and vj . Figs. 8-10, respectively, show
the security index test results with the three Min Cut based
methods (i.e., [12], [18] and the one proposed in this paper).
These figures show only the big M security indices (in light
blue, the heights of the crosses) and the overestimation (in
red, the heights between the crosses and the circles) for the
measurements where the Min Cut based methods do not
agree with big M . The case study indicates that, among the
three Min Cut based methods, the proposed method provides

the most accurate suboptimal solutions to (5). In particular, only
in two cases is the security index overestimated by the proposed
method. In terms of computation time, the proposed method
is most efficient as suggested by Table II. Finally, the lower
bounds for the optimal objective values for (5) (or (8)) can
be obtained following the computation procedure described in
Remark 6. Fig. 11 shows the lower bounds, the exact values of
the security indices, as well as the upper bounds for the two
cases where they are overestimations. Note that even though
without the full measurement assumption the exact security
indices cannot be computed efficiently, the bounds obtained by
the proposed method provide valuable insight about the security
of the network. For instance, the relatively small upper bounds
of the security indices necessarily imply the corresponding
measurements are vulnerable to unobservable data attack. This
is because the true security indices can only be smaller than
the already small upper bounds provided by the proposed
computation procedure.

the proposed procedure provides very accurate upper bounds (there are only
two cases with overestimations), the quality of the lower bounds obtained using
the method described in Remark 6 is not as good.
VIII. CONCLUSION
It has been assumed that the security index problem, formulated
as a cardinality minimization problem, cannot be solved
efficiently. This paper formally confirms this conjecture by
showing that the security index problem is indeed NP-hard.
Nevertheless, the security index problem can be shown to
be reducible to a Min Cut with node costs problem
(Problem 1) under the full measurement assumption. In this
paper, we show that this problem is equivalent to a standard
Min Cut problem on an auxiliary graph of proportional size,
and can therefore be solved exactly and efficiently using standard
techniques for the Min Cut problem. Under the full
measurement assumption, this allows computing the minimal
number of measurements with which one must tamper in order
to feed incorrect information on the SCADA system without
being detected by a BDD method. The knowledge of this number
can help strategically assigning protection resources (e.g.,
[9], [43]). Our method also solves a mathematically equivalent
problem of robustness of the observability properties of the system
with respect to the failure of some measurements, assuming
again full measurement. It remains to be determined if the
solution could be efficiently approximated in the general (not
fully measured) case. Indeed, even though our approach already
provides an approximate solution to such general problems we
do not know if this approximation comes with any guarantee of
accuracy.
Another interesting issue is the design question: in view of
the exact solution of the security index problem presented in
this paper, could one build efficient design methods in order to
optimize the security index under some natural constraints?
