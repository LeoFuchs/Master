Coordinated Cyber-Attacks on the Measurement
Function in Hybrid State Estimation
Yacine Chakhchoukh, Member, IEEE, and Hideaki Ishii, Senior Member, IEEE
Abstract-The paper assesses the cyber-security of power systems
static state estimation (SE) in the possible presence of phasor
measurement units (PMUs). Attacks are considered in the Jacobian
matrix or the measurement function of the state estimation
leading to the presence of coordinated leverage points. Leverage
points, which are outliers, constitute a very challenging attack configuration
even if randomly present. It is shown that coordinated
cyber-attacks when applied to the Jacobian matrix raise major
concerns about robust SE. The vulnerability of the least trimmed
squares (LTS) estimator, which is robust towards leverage points,
is shown. More generally, the weaknesses of robust regression equivariant
estimators are discussed if attacks are developed and optimized
based on a projection framework. Attack scenarios are outlined
considering the number of attacked Jacobian elements, a decomposition
of the system to maximize robustness, and whether a
DC or AC formulation is used by the operator. Stealthy attacks
that stay undetected with respect to the robust LTS are studied.
Masked attacks are defined as well. Some possible solutions and
remedial actions are proposed. Robust state estimation methods
are evaluated and compared in the presence of different configurations
of attacks through Monte Carlo simulations on the IEEE
14- and 30-bus test beds.

measurement units (PMUs), very large sets of data are available
and need to be transferred and analyzed in near real time. These
different tasks should be completed automatically, with high frequency
and within short execution time intervals to operate efficiently
the future power system. As a direct consequence of this
evolution, the vulnerability and risks linked to cyber-attacks of
operating the system will grow. An attacker can, for example,
complete his adverse actions from remote places without even
accessing the physical system. Since disturbing the normal operation
of the power cyber-system has tremendous financial and
security effects, it is vital to offer effective counter-measures to
cyber-attacks.
One of the most important tasks for operating the grid is estimating
the state of the system. A state estimator (SE) evaluates
the voltage magnitudes and phase angles at different buses
of interest [2], [3]. SE is important for contingency analysis to
improve security, load forecasting, evaluating locational marginal
pricing (LMP) for power markets, control and many other
fundamental power applications. Different aspects of SE have
been widely studied in power systems literature [2], [3]. Among
those aspects, robust state estimation and outliers detection are
of great importance [4], [5]. Outliers are deviations from an assumed
model such as errors due to sensor failures, communication
or human errors, certain connection or line conditions.
The proposed robust methods consider outliers as occurring randomly
due to some natural failures. The goal of robust methods
is to fit a reasonable model to the majority of the data and tolerate
some departures from the strict assumed parametric model
without compromising the estimator performance.
Recently, several papers have raised the issue of cyber-attacks
and how SE would be impacted by such disturbances [6]-[9].
In this case, the bad data present in certain meters is not accidental
but generated by an intruder or attacker and coordinated
in a fashion to avoid detection. Cyber-attacks can be viewed
as special cases of outliers whose treatment is complex and of
great importance. Improving cyber-security can be very challenging
especially if attacks are generated by adversaries that
have good knowledge of SE and robust methods used by the
power operator. The knowledge and access degrees of attackers
play a determining role in the detectability and possible actions
against adverse disturbances. In [6], it is shown that an attacker
can introduce a contamination called by false data injection attacks
using the knowledge of the structure of the power system.
Classical detection methods based on analyzing the residuals
of the SE would not be able to detect such intrusions. In [7],
the knowledge of the power system by the attacker was considered
to be approximate and not exact which, in many cases, is
more realistic. The worst configuration of attacks for the power

operator was derived. The paper [8] generalizes the analysis to
an alternative current (AC) SE. The properties of the AC representation
present some advantages in detecting undetectable
attacks over a simplified direct current (DC) representation. The
paper [9] proposes a solution against stealthy attacks based on a
Bayesian detection scheme. The approach exploits the distribution
of the power state over time which is assumed to be multivariate
Gaussian. Recently, [10] proposed an attack configuration
on the measurement in the observation vector and the circuit
breakers status readings to contaminate the estimated topology
at the topology processor. Counter-measures have been proposed
against such stealthy attacks by finding a set of sensors
(PMUs) to be secured [11]. Reference [12] has studied the impact
of cyber-attacks on power markets due to errors in the state
estimates and topology. More generally, the topic of cyber-security
is of interest in several research communities such as
control, signal processing, communication and power systems
[13]-[15].
In this paper, we are interested in possible attacks on the Jacobian
matrix during SE and their impact on highly robust estimators
resistant towards leverage points such as the least trimmed
squares estimator (LTS). Even if the observations are clean from
any modification, attacks in the Jacobian matrix can give rise
to leverage points which are very challenging to treat in practice
even when generated randomly. Scenarios that create an
undetectable stealthy contamination are dangerous for robust
SE. Stealthy attacks are derived theoretically for this context.
Masked attacks are defined as well. The detection capabilities
of the most popular diagnostic approaches used in power systems
are studied theoretically and numerically.
The paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the
power SE in the presence of outliers and coordinated cyber-attacks.
Section III develops stealthy cyber-attacks on the Jacobian
matrix considering leverage points-robust estimators. Conditions
are derived to optimize attacks from the intruders' point
of view on both AC and DC formulations. Masked attacks are
defined. Robust regression equivariant estimators are investigated.
Remedial actions are proposed as well. In Section IV,
simulation results are run on the IEEE 14- and 30-bus test beds
comparing several diagnostic methods. A variant of the least
trimmed squares (LTS) with decomposition is proposed as a reference
robust method towards leverage points. Both randomly
generated outliers and coordinated cyber-intrusions scenarios
are assessed. Finally, Section V concludes the paper.
II. STATE ESTIMATION IN THE PRESENCE OF CYBER ATTACKS
AND OUTLIERS
In this section, an overview is presented about the literature
dealing with coordinated cyber attacks and random outliers in
the SE context. A variant of least trimmed squares with decomposition
is finally proposed as a benchmark evaluation method
that is robust against leverage points.
The goal of SE is to estimate the bus voltage magnitudes
and phase angles considered in the -dimensional state vector
from the observation -dimensional given by

The nonlinear function is linearized and solved iteratively
using the weighted least squares (WLS), which is optimal under
Gaussian noise. Table I illustrates the algorithm [2], where is

and norm such as the infinite or Euclidean norm. The statistical
model used in SE is evaluated and updated by the topology processor
which tracks the system topology change over time.
A. Stealthy Cyber Attacks Introduced in Observations for SE
Several papers in the cyber-security literature considered
stealthy attacks generated in the observation vector . The
paper [6] discussed the possibility of stealthy attacks that
remain undetected by any usual detection approach based on
analyzing the residuals. An adverse can, for example, add a
vector to the observations contained in to contaminate
the estimated state . This can be proven as follows. After
neglecting the iterations effect (asymptotic case), consider the
linearized regression model
where, for simplicity, the error covariance is assumed to be the
identity matrix, i.e., Cov . A simple matrix transformation
of the data insures this condition. Assuming that the system
is observable means that is full rank, i.e., . The
LS estimator is given by . Furthermore, the
vector of residuals is simply

decomposing the power system which is robust against leverage
points. The number of treated outliers is maximized thanks to
the decomposition. The operator is assumed to be very cautious
where an observation is flagged as oultying even if detected in a
single island. The algorithm is outlined in Table II and explained
as follows.
First decompose the power system in radial and elementary

power injections means simply that an injection at a given bus
is corrected by removing the flows at cut-lines connected to the

is . The weights are adapted as well where the corresponding

. Notice that a detected contaminated injection can be
due to the injection itself or to the flows on the cut-lines. In this
variant, if the outlier is due to the initial injection, then only
the injection is flagged. If it is due to a cut-line flow, then both
the flow and the injection are rejected. This variant is very safe
where the union of all detected outliers is removed.
Notice that even leverage points resistant estimators such as
LTS can not deal with stealthy attacks on the whole observation
vector [6].

access to more than points of in the concerned island,
then there is no need to check for redundancy.
A. Coordinated Stealthy Attacks on the Jacobian Matrix
In scenario 2, a precise state is targeted to reach a predetermined
contaminated state which can be useful for an intruder
with possible financial gains, for example, after impacting the
electricity markets. Creating an attack that does not disturb the
residuals from WLS, which is very sensitive to leverage points
and optimal in the outlier-free case, means that the attack obeys
the regression structure. The development provides a very
stealthy disturbance for a large spectrum of robust estimators.
Diagnostic approaches are generally based on a majority of
residuals which are obeying the true model and a minority of
deviant outliers. If all residuals are not impacted and behaving
the same, detecting the attack can not be achieved. This philosophy
is followed to study the feasibility of stealthy attacks
against leverage points robust estimators.
The contaminated WLS estimate is given by
As mentioned above, we consider an attack configuration
where the Jacobian is modified. This would create what is
known as leverage points that can generate extra-complication
for methods that analyze WLS residuals, such as the largest
normalized residual, even when the residual caused by the
attack is non-null in (3). The point is that the largest
residuals, in this case, do not necessarily correspond to the
outliers (i.e., leverage points). This is called the masking effect
in robust statistics literature and analyzing the residuals of the
WLS is not really a good approach [17]. Considering this fact
can motivate an intruder to attack instead of the observation
vector .
We consider two scenarios with different convergence of the
SE following attacks. where is the contaminated Jacobian matrix given by

We now discuss the two scenarios separately in the following. Similarly, the contaminated residuals are given by
Scenario 1 can be achieved by generating more outliers than
the breakdown point. If sophisticated methods robust towards
leverage points are used, the intruder has to go beyond their
limits. If the estimator breaks down, it can be very difficult to
detect attacks and their positions post-estimation based on the
residuals. Indeed, a possibly important bias is the consequence The matrix is a projector on
of the breakdown of a robust estimator. This implies the irrel- and
evance of estimated residuals in order to detect the intrusions
(masking effect). Since the WLS has a null-breakdown point
in the presence of leverage points [17], it can not be
trusted to handle even one intrusion in . We call these attacks
masked attacks.
If the LTS with decomposition is considered, a possible approach
for the attacker would be to detect the weakest points in
the grid. The weak points are elements in the Jacobian linked
to buses with low redundancy limiting the feasible breakdown
point of the robust approach such as the LTS. Indeed, the breakdown
point is bounded by the redundancy as in
[19] where and are the number of estimation points considered
and the redundancy in the th island respectively. This
means that the weak points are found in the islands with minimum

; since
, the created bias is
. In the absence of contamination, . In this
case, both the mean and the variance of the residuals vector are
impacted by the attack, which was not the case with the previous
attack configuration (i.e., an attack on only).
In this scenario, the objective of the attacker is to reduce any
detection post-estimation and ideally to eliminate it by keeping
the residuals the same. This can be achieved by making the
residuals bias zero. Indeed, the distribution function of the
residuals being symmetric (Gaussian distribution), reducing the
bias in absolute value will reduce the chance to be detected.
Notice also that minimizing the bias in the residuals is crucial
to mask an intrusion since it is known and expected by the operator
to be null in the clean case (assuming ). The variance
, on the other hand, is estimated or computed at a given
snapshot and it is difficult for the operator to check whether an
attack occurred based on an inflated variance . As an example,
the normalized residual, which is expected to follow a standard
Gaussian, is given by . The covariance is
used instead of by the operator since the Jacobian is contaminated.
This means that and the
attack's impact can be detected from the bias only. The bias is
generally much larger than the variance.
where is the ceiling function. The breakdown point for
a reasonable robust method is inferior to half. If the attacker has

spanned by columns of to avoid inducing a bias in the residuals.
It joins also the condition derived in [10], where is attacked
to modify in the topology processor.
We believe important to mention that other robust approaches
such as LMS and LAV do not have necessarily a projection
interpretation. Considering this makes the problem seem complex
theoretically. However, several of the developed robust
methods insure regression equivariance: An estimator
satisfies this property if [17]
Regression equivariance by definition means that the estimator
is not resistant against a linear translation on . In this
case, this good property in the case of partly perturbed data can
be exploited by the attacker. Thus, if a robust estimator is said
to satisfy regression equivariance, then it does not stand the previously
discussed attack (i.e., ).
Confidence intervals are also modified by the intruder following
an attack, which is not the case for attacks on . Indeed,
the estimates asymptotic covariance matrix is
instead of .
B. Scenario 2 Attacks on Practical Power Systems
There are a few important factors that might simplify further
the task of an intruder when combined to (6). These factors are
presented as follows.
As explained, the regression estimation considers points in
the -dimensional space, i.e., with being
the th row of the Jacobian . A stealthy attack can be achieved
as well if more row values in the Jacobian matrix than given

are modified in a coordinated fashion around an erroneous state
. Then the LTS (or any other robust estimator) will reject even
the remaining good data detected as outliers since they are in minority.
This is an interesting result since it shows that it is possible
to transform the advantage provided by a high breakdown
point robust estimator to a weak point. It allows the attacker to
reduce further targeted positions in .
Furthermore, since is very sparse in real life power systems,
the previous analysis can be completed on a subsystem of
the power grid. Generating the previously derived condition can
be completed by an attacker, to contaminate a few bus states of
interest. A null bias for the observation residuals linked to these
targeted states would be insured. This means that if (2) can be
rewritten as follows:
To reduce the bias, it is useful to introduce the projector on
the image of where
. The Euclidean norm of the bias is given by
Using the definition of smallest principal angle between two
spaces and its link to two orthogonal projectors as defined in
[7] (Definition 1 and Lemma 1), we have
where is the smallest principal angle between the spaces of
the projectors and , which are respectively and
. The term is not available
since it depends on the unknown true state. Even in the case
where an estimate of is available to the intruder by accessing
PMUs for example, the term should not be minimized
since it reflects the impact of the attack on the estimation bias
or the committed error on estimating the state. Indeed, the estimation
is given by
Decreasing to zero reduces the estimation bias which
should be avoided. For example, .
Hence, the term that can be manipulated by an attacker to reduce
is , i.e., should be made as near as possible to
. This implies that is as closely orthogonal
as possible to or, ideally, both spaces are orthogonal.
This condition is satisfied if, for example, has an included
or the same image space as , i.e.,
The diagnostic post-estimation of residuals where the WLS is
executed will clearly not flag such an attack.
Moreover, the LTS, which is robust against leverage points
as discussed earlier, will not be able to detect such an intrusion
either. This is because the LTS can be seen as an orthogonal
projection problem on a space of . Indeed, the LTS is
equivalent to the WLS applied to a clean set containing a reduced
number of points having the smallest
squared residuals and contained in by keeping the rows of
corresponding to the clean set, i.e., .
Notice that these attacks can be seen theoretically as a contamination
in of a special kind even if, in practice, the robust
estimation tools needed are very different to handle both situations.
Asymptotically, the estimation problem is equivalent to
. An attack can be seen as modifying the
observation by . Such transformation will change the
problem into an estimation with the regressors matrix , i.e.,
. However, the introduced attack is linked to the
obtained contaminated which depends on the true state and
as follows: . This can be viewed
as a special constraint. The condition of an absolute stealthy attack
when analyzing the residual consists in the same spirit, i.e.,
to create an additive element in the equation that is in the space

In order to contaminate points among all observations
linked to this state portion are modified by the stealthy intrusion.
If a decomposition of the power system is conducted and
depending on the decision process followed by the operator to
classify whether an observation is an outlier or not, the number
of attacked elements can be reduced. If, for example, the operator
is not very safe by flagging an overlapping observation as
outlying only if detected in all islands, the attacker can reduce
. This can be achieved by considering the observations in
one subsystem only (i.e., ) instead of modifying all observations
linked to the bus state. In this case, and are quantities
corresponding to one island. Furthermore, the island with
minimum redundancy (i.e., ) is a good candidate, if accessed,
to reduce .
An intruder might prefer scenario 1 over 2 since it needs less
contaminated positions (breakdown is inferior to half). However,
scenario 2 has the advantage of controlling the modified
states and being stealthy.
To illustrate the development above, we consider a stealthy
attack on . For (8) to be satisfied should belong to
the space generated by the first column , which implies
that . This means that the number
of attacked elements in should be equal to the number of
non-zero elements in denoted by . Then, the obtained new
state is . A weaker constraint would be to generate
, where is constituted by any
dimensional set of elements
from . If the attacker accesses the breakdown point
, then the number of necessary attacked positions to generate
a stealthy intrusion is known .
If the breakdown point is unknown, the attacker can still estimate
an interval for . Indeed, the breakdown point satisfies
, where is the redundancy measure of the
island. Knowing and , the attacker can find some interval
where varies, i.e., .
This is particularly true for a DC formulation (linear regression
problem). With an AC formulation, the linearization is not
applied to updating the residuals (See Table II). Thus, there
are two attack possibilities: 1) attacking the Jacobian matrix
without changing . 2) attacking which implies also a contaminated
. If a stealthy attack is desired exactly on certain
states without disturbing the rest of the buses, attacking and
modifying by was shown to be effective
by simulation results (See Section IV).
If a stealthy attack is created where the observations are modified
in order to make the estimate of biased by (i.e.,
), then the algorithm proposed in [8] flags the number of
non-null elements in . The same number of elements should
be known in to create . Since for an AC SE depends on
the state of the previous SE or even the previous iteration, such
an attack requires quite a large access to the data of the system.
Both bus connection and redundancy in measurements play
a determining role in the value taken by . This information
is included in which means that accessing the Jacobian is
important for generating stealthy attacks.
Furthermore, the attacker should target active power injections
and flows if a phase angle is targeted. In this case, the
reduces where considers only the measurements linked to the
phase angles. If voltage magnitudes are targeted, the reactive
power should be attacked and reduces in the same fashion.
This is important since the active power is preponderant in determining
the phase angle estimates whereas reactive power is
important for voltage magnitude.
C. Illustration on a Practical Power System
The previous discussion is illustrated further on the IEEE 14
bus system depicted in Fig. 1 where the decoupled SE combined
to the LMS after decomposing the power system as in [19] is
studied. The same results are obtained when considering the
LTS with the same breakdown point. The obtained subsystems
after decomposition [19] are, by bus number, grouped in
Cyclic islands
and one radial island
The active power-phase angle iteration, for example, uses the
Jacobian matrix given by [2]:
where the parameters and reflect the system
topology representing conductances and susceptances, i.e.,
system admittance. The state at bus includes the voltage
magnitude , and phase angle . The difference between the
phase angles at buses and is . The power flow
between bus and is represented by , and is the active
power injection at bus . The power values are measured.
The vulnerability of the cyclic subsystem composed by buses
{1,2,5} can be analyzed as follows. The taken measurements are
and . Two new power
injections are computed for this island after removing the power
flows on the cut-lines, i.e., and
. The phase estimation problem at the island
where contains all the pre,
i.e., and
becomes
vious measurements,
.
A scenario 2 attack is illustrated as follows. Notice that buses
{2,5} are present in other subsystems whereas bus 1, which is
connected to two buses only, is exclusively estimated in this
subsystem. If an attacker targets , i.e., , the first
column of is analyzed showing seven non-null components.
The breakdown point of the LMS is fixed to three. If four
elements in are modified as ,
then the contaminated estimate is (scenario 2, bus
1 is not the slack bus). A scenario 1 attack can be generated if
four outliers are created randomly.

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER SYSTEMS, VOL. 30, NO. 5, SEPTEMBER 2015
The first column of shows interdependent elements. For
example, depends on the
states at buses 1 and 2 as well as and . The element components
are present in measurements . Another
contamination would completely break the LMS estimator even
if the intrusion is completed in the observation vector .
To create a classical stealthy attack on observations, seven observations
should be manipulated and seven should be known in
. Attacking , in this example, reduces the minimum number
of necessary targeted positions .
D. Possible Remedial Actions for Power Operators
Estimators that analyze independently of can offer advantages
in some cases. If some structure or confidence intervals
are known about a few elements in , this knowledge
might provide a solution to stealthy intrusions targeting . Such
methods can not keep good leverage points in the estimation but
a possible rejection of a good leverage point in order to insure
robustness against cyber-attacks can constitute a good compromise.
Combining two robust approaches and comparing their
estimates might be a good solution.
Knowledge of the topology and placement of measurements
by intruders is dangerous for power companies. Securing the
topology processors and different communication channels
is also of great importance. Furthermore, the topology can
be masked in the cyber-information, which avoids finding
weak points by an intruder. For example, keeping erroneous
information that a bus is connected to more than one bus when
in reality it is connected to a unique bus can help.
More specifically, this could be formulated as follows. If the
knowledge of the Jacobian matrix is approximative, i.e.,
, the attacker would disturb by introducing
while thinking that is . The attacker action creates in reality
. As in (6), the intruder would try to
satisfy that is as closely orthogonal as possible
to . A solution would be to generate satisfying
implying that the real bias in Euclidean
norm created by the attack is proportional to the cosine
of the smallest principle angle between the spaces
and . A possible objective
for the operator consists in creating an uncertainty
expected to maximize this bias or to make and
as closely parallel as possible. Such a solution
was considered for attacked [7].
The cyber-security is improved by increasing the total
number of placed measurements. More specifically, PMUs can
play a key role against attacks in the Jacobian. Indeed, it is
known that the element in the Jacobian corresponding to a
PMU is fixed to 1. There is no real need to manipulate, compute
or transmit this component which makes it safe against intrusion.
A check that an element corresponding to a PMU in is
equal to 1 is a good way to detect an intrusion as well. A good
approach to improve cyber-security could be to install PMUs
at critical islands with low redundancy. Furthermore in [10], a
placement of PMUs was proposed to secure topology processors
against attacks. The authors assumed that the injections
delivered from PMUs were safe.
IV. SIMULATION RESULTS
We continue with the IEEE 14 bus system setting in
Section III-C. The SE program available in MATPOWER
[21] was used and modified to introduce the robust LTS with
decomposition. An algorithm for multivariate LTS estimator
is provided in [22] and adapted to handle sparsity in the grid
(See Table II). The true state of the system is known from
the power flow solution. The slack bus was considered at bus 1
where voltage magnitude was forced to 1 p.u. and phase angle
to zero. The system has been decomposed in eight subsystems.
Each bus of the system is assumed to have a voltage magnitude
measurement and both active and reactive power injections.
Each line has two active and two reactive power flows at its
ends. This is considered to be a high redundancy measurements
configuration, which provides a benchmark study with a highly
robust and rich case. Showing that even in this case attacks can
be stealthy or masked to the operator emphasizes the danger
of cyber-attacks. Indeed, the concern is increased since the
redundancy is lower. The evaluation index of the estimation
quality for the Monte Carlo simulation is
(9)
where is the number of considered Monte Carlo runs. The
state is the estimate at the th run and is the Euclidean
norm. Voltage phase angles and voltage magnitudes errors are
evaluated separately, i.e., two indices are computed.
The number of introduced leverage points and observation
outliers are and respectively. The number of detected
leverage points that are truly present in the attack is denoted
by . The quantity is its observation outliers counterpart.
The number of outliers detected which are neither generated
leverage points nor observation outliers is . The estimated
probabilities of detection for leverage points and observation
outliers are:
. The detection indices
.
The estimated probability of false detection is defined by
.
The first simulation analyzes the detection performance of
three robust methods to randomly generated outliers. The outliers
are introduced in the Jacobian matrix and observation
vector . The three robust methods are the LTS with decomposition
(Table II), the popular largest normalized residual (LRr) and
residual analysis (RA) [2]. RA is based on rejecting residuals
obtained from WLS and departing from the Gaussian assumption
(i.e., reject any residual ). The number of
observations is 123 and .
At each MC run, a different set of quantities is generated for
the observation noise, the locations and magnitudes of leverage
points and observation outliers. Each island contains a leverage
point placed randomly. One observation outlier is generated and
placed randomly in the first seven islands. The island 8 was free
from any observation outlier since it contains only 12 measurements.
The LTS breakdown points were fixed to for
each island. Each element in the observation outliers is
generated following a Gaussian , where is the

the states from a SCADA SE (post-processing) when an attack
is suspected might be a good solution.
The attack configuration satisfying (8) is also considered on
the IEEE 30 bus systems where the phase angle of bus 5 is
targeted. The system is decomposed into 12 subsystems [4] as
follows: {2,4,5,6,7}, {2,5,6,7}, {6,8,28}, {6,9,10}, {27,29,30},
{10,21,22}, {12,14,15}, {1,2,3,4}, {10,12,15,16,17,18,19,20},
{6,8,10,22,24,25,27,28},
{10,15,18,19,20,21,22,23,24},
{4,6,9,10,12,16,17}. The attack's magnitude is
.
Fig. 3 depicts the average absolute errors at each bus for both
voltage magnitude and phase angle. Similar conclusions as in
the case of the 14 bus system can be drawn.
The difficulty in generating the previous attacks in the Jacobian
varies depending whether an AC or DC power flow is used.
For the DC model, topology attacks seem easier to generate due
to the linear model. For example, if the attacker wants to mislead
the operator into thinking that a line is open, he needs to
eliminate the measured flow (i.e., null) at that line and change
the binary state of the circuit breaker or switch received by the
operator to indicate open. The injections measured and linked
to that line should be modified as well. In this case, the operator,
after checking that the flows and injections correspond
with the new state of the circuit breaker, validates that erroneous
topology. Concerning the AC model, an attack could also target
the switches states and measurements. However, it seems more
complex practically to generate a stealthy attack since the linearized
Jacobian depends on the unknown state which requires
to read surrounding PMUs or a larger knowledge of the system
by the intruder. More measurements should be contaminated as
well and using the nonlinear measurement function
in computing
the residuals complicates the task of introducing such attack.
Finally, this means that using an AC over a DC model by
the operator offers the advantage of improving cyber-security.
This is also true in the case where attacks target only the state
of the grid, as observed in [8].
V. CONCLUSION
The paper analyzes the cyber-security of power systems
state estimation considering both DC and AC formulations.
The analysis focuses on attacks on the Jacobian matrix, i.e.,
regressors in the SE regression model which creates possibly
coordinated leverage points. Conditions to generate stealthy attacks
against robust estimators and diagnostic methods keeping
good leverage points, and especially the least trimmed squares
with decomposition, are derived. Factors simplifying stealthy
attacks creation are highlighted. Some possible solutions and
remedial actions are discussed. PMUs are effective against
such stealthy attacks especially if used in post-processing. AC
formulation offers also some additional complication for an
intruder.
