Stealthy Attacks in Power Systems: Limitations on Manipulating the
Estimation Deviations Caused by Switching Network Topologies
Shaocheng Wang and Wei Ren
Abstract- The reliability and robustness of the power system
have gained increasing attention as the trend of including more
information infrastructures into the current power grid. The
stealthy attack is a kind of cyber attack that is undetectable to
any residue-based detection scheme. Our previous work [1] has
shown that the existence of such attacks can be eliminated by
rotationally switching off one of some preselected links which
contain a spanning tree of the network graph. In this paper,
we extend our previous work, to consider the case when the
attack is only stealthy in some of the topologies. The possible
consistent deviations of the estimated states are formulated.
We show that as the attack is stealthy in more topologies, the
flexibility of such deviations is linearly decreased. Several cases
are studied to show this trade-off.
I. INTRODUCTION
There is no doubt that the electric power system, which is
one of the most complicated engineered systems, plays a vital
role in the modern life. Therefore, its reliability becomes a
big concern. The Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition
(SCADA) system is in charge of monitoring and controlling
the power system. The state estimator, which obtains the
measurements from the SCADA system, is in charge of
estimating the unknown states in the network. The system
operator uses these estimated states as the critical reference
for getting knowledge of the system and making the next-step
decisions. Some applications such as Optimal Power Flow,
Automatic Generation Control and Contingency Analysis are
highly dependent on the state estimation [2]. Therefore, it is
critical to have an accurate and reliable estimate of the states.
Bad estimates will offer the system operator with inaccurate
information of the system, which may cause wrong decisions
and finally, cause outages in the network.
The idea of the smart grid has gained significant attention
and is regarded as the future tendency of the current
power network. While it has the advantages of providing
a better “situational awareness” by using communications
and intelligent technologies, its expansion of the information
infrastructures also brings vulnerabilities and shortcomings
[3]. In [4], a kind of cyber attacks, namely, the false data
injection attack (FDIA) was proposed. The FDIA is launched
by injecting malicious data into the meters in order to fool the
system operator with the corrupted data. The stealthy attack
is defined as a strategically designed FDIA such that it does
not trigger the false data alarm whenever the uncorrupted
data does not. Countermeasures to disable such attacks are
considered in [5], where the strategy of adding protected

measurements and verifiable states was proposed. However,
such a strategy usually requires the protections on a large
number of meters which can be costly, especially with the
increase of the grid's size. The security index, as the metric
for quantifying the minimum effort to corrupt a certain
measurement in a stealthy manner, was firstly proposed in
[6]. It is essentially a L0 norm minimization problem and
has led to numerous research works [7]-[10]. However, due
to its non-convexity, no algorithm that is both accurate and
computationally efficient has been found.
Although most of the existing literatures assume a fixed
topology for the power network, the topology can be changed
for multiple reasons. The positions of the transformer taps
may change from time to time, which change the admittance
on the transmission lines. The connections among the buses
can be changed either intentionally (switching on/off the
circuit breakers) or passively (line failures). In recent years,
with the trend of including more distributed energy sources,
the concept of microgrids was proposed. This motivates the
study of the intentional scheduled connection/isolation of the
microgrids to/from the main grid (see for example [11]).
Motivated by the aforementioned facts, our previous work
studied the effects on the stealthy attacks caused by switching
the network topologies [1]. It proposed a necessary and
sufficient condition that the topologies have to satisfy in
order to eliminate the existence of such attacks via strategically
switching among these topologies. In this paper, we
extend our previous work. We show that even if the attacker
launches an attack that is only stealthy under some of the
topologies, it will still have limited flexibility to deviate the
estimated states. We formulate this limitation and show the
general form of the feasible deviations that can be achieved.
Several cases are studied to show how this limitation is
related to the decisions that made by both the attacker and
the system operator.
II. PRELIMINARIES
A. Graph Theory Background
The topology of a power system network can be described
by a graph G (V ; E ), where V and E V V are respectively
the set of vertices which stands for the buses, and the
set of edges which stands for the transmission lines. Due
to the fact that power delivered on each transmission line
is bidirectional, the graph for describing the power network
is undirected. Several fundamental concepts of graph theory
are listed as follows:
A path from vertex vi0 to vertex vit is a sequence of
vertices vi0 ; : : : ; vit such that (vi j ; vi j+1 ) 2 E for 0 j < t;
A graph is connected if there exists at least one path
from every vertex to every other vertex;
A graph is disconnected if it is not connected;
A spanning tree1 is a minimal set of edges that connect
all vertices.
In this paper, we assume the power network associated
with G (V ; E ) contains n + 1 buses and l transmission lines.
Therefore, V = fv1; : : : ; vn+1g and E = fe1; : : : ; el g. Then a
directed incidence matrix A0 2 R(n+1) l can be defined to
describe the topology. After arbitrarily assigning the direction
of each transmission line without loss of generality, the
entries of A0 are determined in the following way. For each
link e j, the entry in the ith row and jth column of A0 is
A0(i; j) = 1 if the direction of e j starts at bus i, A0(i; j) = 1
if the direction of e j ends at bus i, A0(i; j) = 0 otherwise.
In the power system network, in order to study the phase
angle of each bus, one bus is required to be arbitrarily selected
as the reference bus. The phase angle of the reference bus
is assumed to be zero so that the phase angles of the other
buses are measured with respect to the reference bus. Then
the truncated incidence matrix A 2 Rn l can be defined by
removing one of A0's row that corresponding to the reference
bus. Some fundamental properties of A and A0 are listed in
the following lemma.
Lemma 1: Let G (V ; E ) be the graph associated with n + 1
nodes. Let A0 be the associated incidence matrix and A be
the truncated version of A0. Then:
i) rank(A0) = rank(A);
ii) 1 2 NullfA0T g, where 1 2 RjV j is an all one vector.
Nullf g denotes the null space of a matrix;
iii) G is connected if and only if rank(A0) = n;
iv) G is disconnected with k components if and only if
rank(A0) = n k + 1.
B. State Estimation in the DC Power Model
The DC power model is commonly adopted for the study
of the power systems [4]-[10]. Let x 2 Rn be the collection of
states of all buses except for the reference bus. Specifically,
the states are the phase angles of all other buses relative
to the reference bus. Let z 2 Rm be the collection of the
measurements including both the power flow on each transmission
line and the power injection or load at each bus
except for the reference bus. Let H 2 Rm n be the topology
matrix with respect to the original network topology where
no transmission line is cut off. Then the relation between the
states and the measurements can be written as z = Hx + w,
where w 2 Rm stands for the measurement noise. In this
paper, we assume only one measurement can be obtained
on each transmission line or bus and therefore m = l + n. Let
D = diagfd1; : : : ; dl g 2 Rl l be a diagonal matrix with each
nonzero diagonal entries di. Here di describes the admittance
of the ith transmission line, 8i = 1; : : : ; l. Then the topology
matrix H will have the form of
H ,
DAT
ADAT

Assuming w as a white Gaussian noise with its covariance
matrix R, the weighted least-square, minimum variance and
maximum likelihood estimation criteria will yield the same
estimator as xˆ = (HT W H) 1HT W z, where xˆ 2 Rn is the
estimate of x and W = R 1 is the weighting matrix.
C. Stealthy Attack against Bad Data Detection
The bad data detector is designed to defend against the
bad data that may be caused by multiple possible reasons
including meter failures or malicious attacks. The residuebased
detectors are usually denoted as a function J(r), where
r , z Hxˆ. Examples include the c2 detector and the largest
normalized residual test (LNRT). The residue-based detectors
are proposed based on the intuition that abnormal data will
drive the estimated states away from their true values. That
is, the alarm is triggered if J(r) t, where the threshold
t is designed according to the desired percentage of the
false alarm rate. The FDIA is injected to the measurement
observed by the system operator [4]. In this case, instead of
observing the true measurement z, the operator is only able
to see the corrupted data zbad , z + za, where za comes from
the injected false data. Let xˆbad be the corrupted estimate of
x. Let Dx be the estimation deviation that is introduced by the
attacker, i.e., Dx = xˆbad xˆ. The stealthy attack is defined as a
special case of FDIA when the attacker selects za = HDx. It
follows that for any residue-based detector, J(r) = J(zbad
Hxˆbad) = J ((z + za) H(xˆ + Dx)) = J (z Hxˆ) = J(r). This
implies that zbad will have the same possibility of triggering
the bad data alarm, as that of z. Thus, the stealthy attack
requires za 2 Im(H), where Im( ) stands for the column space
of a matrix.
III. PROBLEM FORMULATION
A. Switching Topology Scenario
As the extension of our previous work [1], we keep using
the same assumptions and studying the scenario in which the
network topology is switching. In [1], the system operator
was assumed to be able to intentionally switch on/off one
of the selected transmission lines by turns, and therefore
change the system topology. That is, each topology is generated
by cutting off one link in the graph. Considering the
potential issues on the generation-demand balance that might
be caused by cutting off links, we do not allow multiple
transmission lines to be switched off simultaneously. From
the attacker's perspective, it is assumed that the attacker
knows all possible topologies but does not know which one
is currently adopted by the operator. Moreover, the attacker
is also able to compromise a set of measurements that is not
protected [5]. As in [1], we assume that the transient stability
of the network is guaranteed during the topology switching
process. We only consider the network at the steady state for
each topology.
B. Motivation
Since the attacker does not know the topology that is
being adopted, it has to search for an attack that is stealthy
in all possible topologies. Therefore the system operator's
objective is to eliminate the possibility of such an attack
by adopting an appropriate set of topologies by turns, i.e.,
selecting an appropriate set of links to cut off by turns. It
was shown in [1] that the necessary and sufficient condition
is to select a set of links which contains a spanning tree of
the network graph. This implies that for a network with n + 1
buses, the link set should contain at least n entries since it
has to contain a spanning tree. With this condition satisfied,
there will not exist any feasible stealthy attack.
However, it is still possible for a “smart” attacker to
design the attack in a way such that the attack is stealthy
in a majority of the topologies. This motivates the work
presented in this paper. Based on the scenario as described,
in this paper, we study the case when the attacker makes
a concession and designs the attack that is stealthy only in
some of the topologies preselected by the system operator.
Note that the probability of being detected is increasing as
the attack is designed to be stealthy in fewer topologies.
Moreover, we assume that in order to achieve some destructive
objectives, the attack tries to fool the system operator
with consistent deviations of the estimated states by injecting
the aforementioned partially stealthy attack. That is, the
deviations of the corrupted estimates from the real estimates
of the states are identical among all topologies in which the
attack is stealthy. Note that this is more preferable from the
attacker's point of view, since a consistent deviation from
the real state is more likely to fool the operator. We consider
the following questions. 1) What is the relation between this
estimation deviations and the probability of the attack being
detected? 2) What do the deviations look like? 3) What are
the countermeasures to minimize the effects caused by such
attacks?

of the matrix A. za(i) is the ith entry of za. P = fi1; : : : ; ing

being zero. Hni is the topology matrix defined by (1) with
respect to Ani. VI V is the set of buses connected by
the links of EI . 0 is an all zero vector with an appropriate
dimension. jV j denotes the cardinality of the set V .
IV. MAIN RESULT
In this paper, we only study the scenario in which the
attacker tries to “hide” in a subset of the topologies preselected
by the system operator. However, we will show that
for other cases in which the attacker is also stealthy in some
other topologies that are not preselected, can be converted
to the case studied in this paper. The detailed explanation
is skipped at this point since it requires the conclusion of
Corollary 1 that will be given later on. To begin stating our
219
main results, two definitions, namely, trivial and nontrivial
topology matrices are given as follows:
Definition 1 (nontrivial topology matrices): Suppose that
jI j = p. fHnik jik 2 I g is a set of p nontrivial topology
matrices if rank(AI ) = p.
Definition 2 (trivial topology matrix): Let fHnik jik 2 I g
be a set of nontrivial topology matrices. Then H k is a trivial
n
topology matrix spanned by the these nontrivial topology
matrices if rank ([AI jak]) = rank(AI ).
From Definition 1, it is clear that EI will contain no cycle
in G (V ; E ). Similarly, Definition 2 implies that if fHnik jik 2
I g span the trivial topology matrix Hnk, fekg [ EI will
contain a cycle in G (V ; E ). Since AI is a submatrix of
A, p rank(A). In this paper, we assume that G (V ; E ) is
connected. Therefore p n. This implies that the operator
can preselect at most n topologies whose associated topology
matrices are nontrivial. In the rest of this paper, fHnik jik 2
P g denotes the set of these n nontrivial topology matrices.
Let fHnik jik 2 I g be the set of p nontrivial topology matrices
associated with the p topologies in which the attack za is
stealthy. The following definition will be frequently used in
the rest of this paper.
Definition 3 (( p; n)-stealthy attack): Suppose that I
P . za is a ( p; n)-stealthy attack if za 2 \ik2I Im(Hnik ) and
za 2= Im(Hnik ), 8ik 2 P n I .
Before stating our main result, we first state the following
lemma that will be used for the proof of our main theorem.
Lemma 2: Suppose that the attacker is able to launch an
attack za that is stealthy in the p topologies whose associated
nontrivial topology matrices form the set fHnik jik 2 I g, i.e.,
za 2 \ik2I Im(Hnik ). Then za(ik) = 0, 8ik 2 I .
Proof: From the definition of Hnik , the entries of the ikth
row of Hnik are all zeros since cutting off the ikth link will
cause the ikth column of the corresponding incidence matrix
Anik being all zeros. Thus, if za 2 Im(Hnik ), za(ik) = 0. Since
this condition has to be satisfied for all of the topologies in
which za is stealthy, it follows that za(ik) = 0, 8ik 2 I .
Theorem 1: Suppose that the attacker launches an attack
za that is stealthy in p( p 2) topologies. Let fHnik jik 2 I g
be the set of the associated nontrivial topology matrices.
Then za can only be designed in the way such that the
deviation of the estimated states Dx satisfies Dx 2 NullfATI g.
Proof: Recall that Dx is caused by injecting the stealthy
attack za. Then za = Hnik Dx holds for all ik 2 I . From
Lemma 2, za(ik) = 0, 8ik 2 I . Let HIi be the submatrix
that collects the rows of Hnik whosen kindices are in I ,
i.e., Hnik ( j; :); 8 j 2 I . Therefore, since HIi Dx = 0 for each
ik 2 I , p independent equations can nbek obtained, i.e.,
dik aiTk Dx = 0; 8ik 2 I . Since dik is the admittance value on
the corresponding transmission line and therefore nonzero,
after writing the p equations into a compact matrix form,
one can obtain ATI Dx = 0. It follows that Dx 2 NullfATI g.
Theorem 1 formulates the limitations on the consistent
estimation deviations that can be introduced by the attack za,
where za is stealthy in p topologies associated to p associated
nontrivial topology matrices. It is clear that the size of AT
I
increases as p increases. This makes Dx have to satisfy more
constraints as well.
Remark 1: When the attack is only stealthy in one of the n
topologies (p = 1), za can be designed based on whatever Dx
the attacker wants. This brings us back to the case in which
the graph topology is fixed. Therefore we assume p 2 for
the rest of this paper.
Remark 2: When p = n, Dx can only be a zero vector
due to the fact that rank(AI ) = n leads to NullfATI g = 0/ .
It follows that za = Hnik Dx = 0, 8ik 2 I . Therefore, it is
impossible for the attacker to fool the system operator with
an consistent estimation deviation Dx, via injecting an false
data za that is stealthy in all n topologies preselected by the
system operator. Thus the system operator can choose n such
topologies to eliminate the existence of the stealthy attack.
This is also consistent with the main theorem in [1].
Although in the special case where p = n, Theorem 1 leads
to the same result as in our previous work, it is not sufficient
to prove the main result in [1]. Two theorems are individually
proposed from different perspectives. An example is the case
when G (V ; E ) is a graph that contains only a circle (defined
as the circular graph in [1]), as shown in Figure 1(a). It is
still able to find a stealthy attack even if the operator selects
4 links that form a spanning tree to cut rotationally. This
attack, however, will not be able to deviate the estimated
states with the same value in different topologies.
In summary, there is a trade-off between the flexibility of
manipulating the estimation deviations and the number of the
nontrivial topology matrices associated with the topologies in
which the attack is stealthy. On one hand, the attacker prefers
to launch an attack that is less possibly detected during the
alternations among all possible topologies. This will require
Dx to satisfy more constraints with which the attacker may
not be able to fool the system operator in the way that it
expected. On the other hand, in order to manipulate the
estimation deviations in a more flexible manner, the attacker
has to take the risk of being detected in more topologies.
Corollary 1: Let za be stealthy in p topologies whose associated
nontrivial topology matrices forms the set fHnik jik 2
I g, i.e., za 2 \ik2I Im(Hnik ). Suppose that za deviates the
state estimates by Dx. Then za = HDx = H kDx, where
n
H k stands for any topology matrix that is spanned by the
n
matrices in fHnik jik 2 I g.
Proof: Let Ai be the matrix whose columns are all
zeros except for the ith column be ai. It follows that Ai =
A Ani. Let Hi be defined by (1) with respect to Ai. Then
Hi = H Hni. Therefore, za = HniDx = (H Hi)Dx; 8i 2 I .
Since Dx 2 Null(AT ) from Theorem 1, AiT Dx = 0; 8i 2 I . It
I
follows that HiDx = 0, which implies that za = HDx.
Since Hnk is the topology matrix spanned by the topology
matrices in fHnik jik 2 I g. By Definition 2, rank ([AI jak]) =
rank(AI ). This implies that ak 2 Im(AI ) and therefore
Null([AI jak]T ) = Null(ATI ). From Theorem 1, Dx 2
Null(ATI ). Thus Dx 2 Null([AI jak]T ), which implies that
akT Dx = 0. It follows that HkDx = 0. Therefore, za = HDx =
(H Hk)Dx = HnkDx, which implies that za 2 Im(Hnk). Thus,
za is also stealthy in the topology to which Hnk is associated,
220

i.e. G (V ; Enk). Since this is the case for all trivial topology
matrices spanned by the topology matrices in fHnik jik 2 I g,
one can conclude the proof.
We now explain how problems that are not directly considered
by our main results can be converted to problems to
which our results are applicable. Definition 3 is defined based
on the assumption that I P which might not always be
the case. For example in Figure 1(b), P = f3; 4; 5; 6g, as
shown by the dashed lines, and I = f1; 2; 3; 4g, as shown
by the cross marks. It is clear that I * P in this case.
However, this is equivalent to consider the case as shown in
Figure 1(c), where I 0 = f3; 4; 5g with I 0 similarly defined
as that of I in Figure 1(b). This is due to the fact that
H 1 and H 2 are trivial topology matrices spanned by the
n n
nontrivial topology matrices H 3, Hn4 and H 5. Therefore, by
n n
Corollary 1, a feasible za such that za 2 \i2I Im(Hni) implies
that za 2 \i2I 0 Im(Hni). Note that I 0 P in this equivalent
case so that our main theorem is applicable. In general, if
the operator selects a set of links feiji 2 Pg which contains
a spanning tree of G (V ; E ), the set of topology matrices
fHniji 2 Pg will contain n nontrivial topology matrices.
Moreover, these n nontrivial topology matrices are able to
span any topology matrix H i; 8i = 1; : : : ; l. Therefore, our
n
main results in this paper are applicable to any possible cases.
Theorem 2: Suppose that the attacker is able to launch an
(p; n)-stealthy attack. Then it is only able to independently
manipulate the estimation deviations on n p components of
the graph G (V ; EI ). Moreover, let Ii be the set of indices
corresponding to the ith component of G (V ; EI ). Then the
n p
deviation Dx has the form of åi=1 aieIi ; where ai 2 R is
arbitrary, 8i, and eIi 2 Rn is a vector each entry of which is
one if its index is in Ii and zero otherwise.
Proof: It is clear that AI can be regarded as the truncated
incidence matrix which describes the graph G (V ; EI ).
Since Theorem 1 shows that the case when p = n will lead
to a trivial solution of za from the attacker's perspective, we
only discuss the case when p n 1. Since rank(AI ) =
p, it follows that dimfNull(ATI )g = n p, where dimf g
stands for the dimension of a matrix subspace. Suppose
that G (V ; EI ) contains k isolated components, then from
Lemma 1, we have k = n p + 1 2. By reassigning the
indices of buses, without loss of generality, AI can be
written as AI = diagf[AI1 ; : : : ; AIk ]g, where Ii I is a set
of indices with respect to the ith component in G (V ; EI ),
8i 2 f1; : : : ; kg. Without loss of generality, we let Ik be the
set that contains the index with respect to the reference bus.
It is clear that 8i 2 f1; : : : ; k 1g, each column of AIi contains
only two nonzero entries, namely, 1 and 1. Therefore,
AIi can be regarded as the incidence matrix (similar to A0)
with respect to the graph G (VIi ; EIi ), where VIi is similarity
defined as that of VI . It follows that 1 2 NullfATIi g from
Lemma 1. Moreover, rank(AIi ) = jVIi j 1. Thus, 1 is the
only basis of the left null space of AIi . This is the case for
all i 2 f1; : : : ; k 1g. Therefore for each component that does
not contain the reference bus, the attacker can only deviate
the estimated states of all included buses with the same value.
Using the same reference bus as that of G (V ; E ), it is
clear that AIk is the truncated incidence matrix (similar to A)
with respect to the graph G (VIk ; EIk ). This implies that AIk
is a square matrix. Moreover, since the topology matrices
associated with the p topologies are nontrivial, the columns
of AIk are guaranteed to be independent from each other.
Therefore NullfAIk g = 0/ . This implies that the attacker
cannot manipulate any of the state values in the component
that contains the reference bus. Recall that k = n p + 1.
Therefore the attacker can only independently deviate the
estimates of the n p components that do not contain
the reference bus. It follows that the general form of the
n p
estimation deviations is åi=1 aieIi .
Theorem 2 describes how exactly the flexibility of manipulating
the estimation deviations is limited when the attacker
launches a (p; n)-stealthy attack. It is shown that this flexibility
can be judged by checking the graph G (V ; EI ). It turns
out that this deviation can only be designed in a “component”
sense. That is, for each component in the graph G (V ; EI ),
the estimation deviations for all included states have to be
identical. Moreover, for the component that contains the
reference bus, as a special case, the estimation deviations for
all included states have to be identical to zeros. Therefore,
even though the attacker is possible to launch a feasible
attack that is stealthy in some of the preselected topologies,
it has to confront the limited flexibility of designing the
estimation deviation Dx, especially when it tries to “hide”
in more topologies. This trade-off turns out to be linear,
as proved in Theorem 2. The conclusions of Theorem 2
instantly leads to the following corollary.
Corollary 2: The possibility of a certain (p; n)-stealthy
attack is zero if and only if there exists at least one
independently verifiable bus in each component of G (V ; EI )
that does not contain the reference bus.
The proof of Corollary 2 is straightforward and omitted
here for the sake of saving space. This corollary is motivated
by the fact that Dx for all buses in the same component of
G (V ; EI ) have to be identical. Therefore by guaranteeing
that at least one state can be independently verified (the state
value can be directly observed by some methods that are
independent from the state estimator, see [5] for details), it
is obtained that eIi = 0; 8i 2 f1; : : : ; n pg. Thus Dx = 0. It
follows that za = HDx = 0 from Lemma 2.
Corollary 2 also explains why the estimation deviations of
the states that belong to the component, which includes the
reference bus, have to identically be zero. This is because
of the state value of the reference is assumed to be zero

in order to show the angles of other buses relative to it.
Therefore by Theorem 2, all states in the same component of
G (V ; EI ) will have zero deviations. From this perspective,
the reference bus plays the role of a verifiable state.
V. CASE STUDIES
From Theorem 2, an (n; p)-stealthy attack is only able to
independently deviate n p components in G (V ; EI ). However,
the number of buses in each component of G (V ; EI )
is dependent on both the system operator's selection of
P and the attacker's selection of I ,where I and P are
similarly defined as that of the example shown in Figure
1(b). Moreover, since an (p; n)-stealthy attack is not able
to deviate the estimated states of all buses that included
in the same component with the reference bus, the location
of the reference bus in G (V ; E ) will also contribute to the
limitation as described in Theorem 2. Motivated by these
intuitions, in this section, we use kDxk0, which stands for the
number of nonzero entries of Dx, as the metric to evaluate
how the limitations on the estimation deviation Dx is affected
by the selection of P, I and the reference bus in G (V ; E ).
A. Scenario without Verifiable State
The parameters of all cases that studied in this scenario are
listed in Table I, in which the “Ref” stands for the reference
bus for each case. It is assumed that for each case, a (3; 4)stealthy
attack is launched with the listed choice of I and
P. Dxi denotes the deviated estimates of the ith bus. Note
that this deviation is undefined for the reference bus and
therefore marked as “N/A” in the table. a 2 R is arbitrary.
The details for case 1 is shown in Figure 2 as an example.
Similar figures can be easily derived for other cases in Table
I. We omit them here for the interest of space. In Figure
2(a), the dashed lines form the link set feiji 2 Pg, which
is decided by the operator. The cross marks show the link
set feiji 2 I g, which is decided by the attacker. Figure 2(b)
shows the graph G (V ; EI ), which is the critical graph used
to judge the general form of the deviations of the estimated
states Dx.
For case 1, since it is a (3; 4)-stealthy attack, it is only able
to deviate one component in G (V ; EI ). As shown in Figure
2(b), bus 3 is the only bus that belongs to the component
that does not contain the reference bus v5. Therefore, only
Dx3 can be deviated with an arbitrary value a . If follows
that kDxk0 = 1. For case 2, the only difference from case 1
is the selection of I . As a result, however, the estimated
states of all buses are deviated with the same value and
therefore kDxk0 = 4. This is because in G (V ; EI ) of case 2,
the reference bus is isolated from all other buses. Then all
buses are included in the component that does not contain the
reference bus. Therefore, given the objective to be deviating
more numbers of states from the attacker's perspective, the
selection of I in case 2 is more preferred by the attacker.
In case 3, all parameters stay the same as that of case 2
except that the reference bus is selected as bus 4 instead of
bus 5. However, by simply changing the reference bus, only
one estimate of states can be deviated. Actually, in this case,
any possible (3; 4)-stealthy attack is only able to deviate one
estimated state since all buses are directly connected to the
reference bus in G (V ; EI ). Therefore, case 3 is the most
preferable case form the operator's perspective. In case 4,
using the same reference bus as that of case 3, the selection
of P is changed. It turns out that by selecting I listed
in Table I, the estimates of all states will be deviated, i.e.,
kDxk0 = 4. Thus, this is the least preferable case that the
operator should consider.
Therefore, using kDxk0 as the metric, we summarize the
following two criteria for the system operator to select the
location of the reference bus in G (V ; E ), and the n links to
cut rotationally, in the scenario when there is no verifiable
state. 1) In G (V ; EI ), the reference bus should be directly
connect to as much buses as possible. As shown in the
comparison between case 2 and case 3. 2) The reference bus
should act as the “root” of the spanning tree that formed by
the n links whose indices are in P . Moreover, each branch
of the spanning tree should have as few vertices as possible,
as shown in the comparison between case 3 and case 4.
B. Scenario with Verifiable State
When there exist independently verifiable states [5], the
strategy for the operator to select P will be changed significantly.
A certain ( p; n)-stealthy attack will be impossible
if n p verifiable buses are added in the way described in
Corollary 2. However, it is the attacker's decision to select
which p of the n topologies to “hide” in. The comparison
between case 1 and case 2 in the former scenario has shown
that by selecting different I the attacker will significantly
change the number of estimated states that could be deviated.
Therefore, the operator should try to find a solution to
minimize kDxk0 regardless of the selection of I by the
attacker. Suppose that bus 5 is verifiable in case 4 shown
in Table I, kDxk0 0 for any possible (3; 4)-stealthy attack.
Note that in the scenario without any verifiable state, case
4 is one of the least preferable strategies for the operator to
select P . Case 3 in Table I, however, which is the optimal
strategy in the former scenario, becomes the last strategy that
222
operator would consider in this scenario. This is because for
the scenario with verifiable states, in order to make kDxk0 0
hold for any possible (3; 4)-stealthy attack in case 3, all buses
should be verifiable except for the reference bus. This implies
that the existence of the verifiable states can significantly
change the strategies for selecting P and the reference bus.
VI. CONCLUSIONS & FUTURE WORK
We extended our previous work [1] which studied the
scenario of using the scheme of switching topologies to
defend against the stealthy FDIAs in power system. It is
shown that even if the attack is still feasible to be stealthy in a
majority of the preselected topologies, there is a linear tradeoff
between the flexibility of manipulating the estimation
deviation, and the possibility of not being detected. The
general form of the consistent deviation of the estimated
states are formulated as well. It turns out that this deviation
can only be designed in a “component” sense. Several cases
are studied to show how the deviation can be affected by the
decision made by both the attacker and the operator.
Our future directions include the analysis of the transient
stability during the switching among topologies, the minimum
effort to learn the current topology from the attacker's
perspective, and specifically formulating the objective for
optimally selecting the topology set from the operator's
perspective.
