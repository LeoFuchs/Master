Abstract-The transformation of traditional energy networks to
smart grids can assist in revolutionizing the energy industry in
terms of reliability, performance and manageability. However, increased
connectivity of power grid assets for bidirectional communications
presents severe security vulnerabilities. In this letter, we
investigate Chi-square detector and cosine similarity matching approaches
for attack detection in smart grids where Kalman filter
estimation is used to measure any deviation from actual measurements.
The cosine similarity matching approach is found to be robust
for detecting false data injection attacks as well as other attacks
in the smart grids. Once the attack is detected, system can
take preventive action and alarm the manager to take preventative
action to limit the risk. Numerical results obtained from simulations
corroborate our theoretical analysis.

I. INTRODUCTION
T and consuming energy by providing bi-directional energy
HE smart grids offer a more efficient way of supplying
flow and communications. Increased connectivity in smart grids
and bidirectional communications present severe security challenges.
According to Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory [1], power outages cost over $80 billion every
year in the U.S. alone. Thus, due to the critical nature of the
smart grid services, smart grid systems become a prime target
for cyber terrorism [2], [22]. According to a 2014 Washington
D.C. based Bipartisan policy center report, more than 150 cyberattacks
targeted energy sector in 2013 alone [3] and 79 attacks
in 2014 [4]. Therefore, transformation of traditional energy networks
to smart grids requires integrated end-to-end adaptive
cyber defense strategy to safeguard smart grid communications,
networks and assets used to operate, monitor, and control power
flow and measurements.
Recent related studies for smart grid security include

has been used to secure smart grid systems where distributed
meters are mutually authenticated using Diffie-Hellman key
establishment protocol and hash-based authentication code. In
[6], a generalized likelihood ratio detector has been proposed
for smart grid security with limited number of meters compromised.
Note that the generalized likelihood ratio detector
depends on parametric inferences but is not applicable to
nonparametric inferences based on function estimation [13].
In [7], smart grid security techniques have been proposed by
using supervised learning algorithms. These techniques rely
on a training dataset which is used as a reference to detect the
attacks in new measurements. This approach could be compromised
during training phase and/or the newer attacks including
false data injection attacks could go undetected. None of these
methods consider security techniques for false-data injection
attacks in smart grid systems.
In this letter, we investigate and compare Chi-square detector
and cosine similarity matching for attack detection in
smart grids where expected values are estimated using Kalman
filter [14], [15] that are used to measure deviation from actual
measurements. Note that both approaches are capable of detecting
random attacks (e.g., reply of denial-of-communication)
whereas the cosine similarity approach is also capable of detecting
false data injection attacks in the smart grid. Numerical
results obtained from simulations corroborate our theoretical
analysis presented in this letter.

II. STATE SPACE MODEL AND PROBLEM FORMULATION
In a typical power system, there are buses interconnected
by the transmission lines. The Independent System Operators
(ISOs) monitor the power system through Supervisory Control
and Data Acquisition (SCADA) measurements using sensors
[16]. The received SCADA measurements can be represented
in a compact vector-matrix from as

state variables and is the measurement noise. When the
noise has normal distribution with zero mean and variance
(i.e., with ), then the linear state

vector estimator can be employed [8] to estimate
generation outputs and loads which leads to
including
The goal of the attacker is to insert false data into the measurements
(1) as
where is the false data vector inserted by the attacker. Typical
attack vector is a non-zero vector.
Then the state variable vector can be estimated using (3)
and (2) in stead of (1) and (2) which could be incorrect/wrong
due to attacks or random errors in measurements. False data detection
could be implemented which compares -norm of the
measurement residual [8] against a threshold 1where it determines
that there is an attack (or false data) if
Note that if the -norm is less than , the received measurement
is considered as normal.
This approach has problems as the Jacobian matrix in
smart grid is very sparse, and attackers can insert false data and
by pass the test (4) to attack the smart grid when . Here
is an attack vector [6], [7], [17].
In this letter, our goal is to proposed an alternative approach
to detect false data injection attacks in the smart grids.
Attack Model: In this letter, we assumed that an attacker is
able to control a subset of the sensor readings in the smart grid
system and uses i) DoS attack; ii) random attack; and iii) false
data injection attack. In DoS attacks, an attacker floods packets
in the network to compromises devices to prevent data transfer
and to jam the communication [18]. In random attacks, the
attacker simply manipulates the sensor readings by inserting
random attack vector generated by the attacker. In false data
injection attacks, the attacker is assumed to be familiar to the
system and its parameters used in estimation and detection
including gain matrix [19].
To detect the attacks in smart grid, an IEEE 9-bus system
with sensors to monitor the state parameters and the estimator
and detector is shown in Fig. 1. An open-source MATLABbased
power system simulation package MATPOWER [20] is
used to simulate the IEEE 9-bus system and detect attacks using
Kalman filter based estimation. Kalman filter based estimation
and detection is discussed in the following section.
III. PROPOSED FRAMEWORK FOR ATTACK
DETECTION IN SMART GRID
In this section, we present a security framework which can
detect various attacks including random attacks, denial-of-communication
attacks, replay attacks, and false data injection attacks
in the smart grid. The proposed framework uses Kalman
Filter techniques to estimate the measurements.
1Note that value of the threshold should be chosen based on history and
trade-off between the detection and false alarm probability.
Then, the prediction measurement equation can be written as
The error covariance extrapolation matrix is written as
Using (8), the Kalman gain matrix equation can be written as
Then the error covariance update equation can be written as

Finally, the state estimation update (a posteriori estimate) is expressed
as
Then, the estimation error (i.e., the difference between estimated
value and the actual measurements) can be written as
Fig. 1. IEEE 9-bus system with sensors and attacker.
For Kalman Filter technique, we can write (1) in terms of
state-space equations with discrete time index as
where state transition matrix (can be initialized with an
identity matrix ), is the state noise vector with covariance
matrix .
Then, the Kalman filter equations, for estimation of state variable
vector based on given initial observations, are as follows.
The predicted state or a priori estimate is given as
(2)
(3)
(4)
The estimated values for electrical measurements using
Kalman Filter and the actual measured data using sensors are
used to detect attacks by finding any deviations between them.
Note that we can regenerate the signal using measured data
to compare it with expected or estimated values. If a detector
finds significant differences between these two values with the
Then, the scalar value of residue of the difference vector in (13)
can be computed as
where is the covariance matrix of the vector . The Chisquare
detector compares the scalar residue value
in (14) with a given threshold value which can be obtained by
using Chi-square table to detect attacks (e.g., random attacks
and replay attacks) in the smart grid. This approach is fast and
easy to implement. However, the Chi-square detector can not
detect false data injection attacks as shown under the 'Performance
Evaluation and Numerical Results' section of this letter.
Thus, we propose the cosine similarity matching approach to
detect false data injection attacks in smart grids.
B. Cosine Similarity Matching Approach to Detect False-data
Injection Attacks
False data injection attacks can be crafted to bypass the statistical
detectors such as Chi-square detector. Thus, we propose
cosine similarity matching based approach to detect any deviation
between measured data (using sensor measurements) and
estimated/expected data (using Kalman filter). The cosine similarity
matching metric tells how similar the two data vectors
are. If both vectors are similar, the value of cosine similarity
is one. The cosine similarity metric between the received measurements
and estimated observation
can be written as
where the numerator represents the dot (i.e., inner) product of
the vectors and , and the denominator denotes the
product of their Euclidean lengths.
Note that when there is no false data injection attack, two vectors
and exactly match, and the value of
is equal to one which represents no attack in the smart grid.
However, to compare the performance of the proposed cosine
similarity based approach with Chi-square detector, we compute
the following
and compare it against a given threshold2.
2Note that the threshold that is used to compare with detector output could be
estimated using its history and measurements in the smart grid.

predefined threshold, it triggers an alarm indicating that there
is an attack in the systems.
A. Chi-Square Test as an Attack Detector
The deviation in expected/estimated value (by Kalman Filter)
and measured value (by sensor measurements) is used to detect
malicious attacks in the smart grid. This deviation between there
values for a given time index can be computed as

IV. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION AND NUMERICAL RESULTS
In this section, we simulate different scenarios by using
Matlab to corroborate our theoretical analysis. We consider
sinusoidal signal with frequency 60 Hz, amplitude 1 Volt, sampling
frequency 2000 Hz, , and initial covariance matrix
i.e., an identity matrix. Then, we generated a sine
wave with this configuration and added the additive Gaussian
white noise with zero mean to the signal using the Matlab
function . The input signal and the resulting signal
obtained using state estimation are plotted with and without
attacks. Based on the Kalman filter estimates, we computed
the residue for Chi-square detector using (14) and normalized
it to compare with cosine similarity matching criteria. We also
computed the cosine similarity matching value using (16) and
plotted these values along with a given threshold.
A. Attack/Fault Detection
First, we plotted the variation of signal versus the time for
electrical measurements and its Kalman filter estimation when
no attacks were introduced as shown in Fig. 2(a). For this setup,
we also plotted the residue for Chi-square detector using (14)
and cosine similarity matching value using (16) as shown in
Fig. 2(b). As there is no attacks in the smart grid, the input signal
and estimated signal are close enough and their detection metrics
(14) and (16) lie below threshold. This indicates that there
is no attacks in the smart grid systems.
Second, we introduced random attacks (replay and/or
denial-of-communications attacks) into the smart grid and
applied Kalman Filter to estimate the expected values of the
measurements. Then, we plotted the variation of observations
of electrical measurements and their expected values under
random attacks as shown in Fig. 3(a). In this case, the estimated
data does not corresponds to the measured one as shown in
Fig. 3(a) and thus the residue in (14) exceeds the threshold most
of the time in Chi-square detection and the similarity metric in
(16) also exceeds the threshold as shown in Fig. 3(b). Thus, the
both approaches are able to detect attacks and could trigger an
alarm to indicate attacks in the smart grid.
Then, to see the effect of a random attack that starts at different
time than from beginning, we introduced the attacks at
around middle of the observation period as shown in Fig. 3. Before
attacks started, the observations were close enough with
estimated values by Kalman filter resulting in lower values of
residues than the threshold value for both Chi-square detection
and similarity matching as shown in Fig. 4(b). However, after
attack started, the estimated signal did not correspond to the

measured one as shown in Fig. 4(a) and the detectors resulted
in higher values than the threshold indicating that there were
attacks in the system. This shows that the attacks could be detected
on the fly whenever they start.
B. False Data Injection Attack Detection
In this section, we evaluate the proposed approaches for false
data injection attacks in smart grids. We considered that an attacker
was attacking the smart grid by inserting false data into
measurements using statistics of the measurements [9], [21]. In
this scenario, to see the impact of false data injection attacks, we
used both Chi-square detector and cosine similarity matching
approach using actual measurements and estimated values by
the Kalman filter. Again, it is worth noting that both approaches
were working perfectly when there were no attacks as shown
in Fig. 2. As noted, there was no attack detected since both
Chi-square detector and cosine similarity values were not exceeding
the given threshold.
Then, we considered that there was false data injection attack
in the smart grid where actual measurement observations were
not close enough to estimated values by Kalman filter as shown
in Fig. 5(a). During this attack, the Chi-square detector resulted
in its normalized residue values below its threshold
and thus it was not able to detect the attack in the system as
shown in Fig. 5(b). However, in the same setup, the cosine similarity
matching values ( values) were above the given
threshold as shown in Fig. 5(b). We performed a couple experiments
and observed the same for all cases. Thus, we concluded
that the Chi-square detector is incapable of detecting false data
injection attacks while the cosine similarity matching approach
is capable of detecting false data injection attacks.
Finally, we considered that the false data injection attack was
started approximately before the half of an observation time.
When there was no attack, the estimated values were close to
the actual measurements but they were not close enough after
the attack was started as shown in Fig. 6(a). Both detectors

were resulting in lower values than the threshold indicating that
there was no attack during first half of the experiment. Even
after attack was started, the Chi-square detector was unable to
detect the attacks as its residue values were below threshold
whereas the cosine similarity detector was able to detect the attack
as it was giving higher values than the threshold as shown
in Fig. 6(b). We performed several experiments and confirmed
that the cosine similarity matching approach was capable of detection
attacks regardless of the starting time of the false data
injection attacks. However, Chi-square detector was unable to
detect the false data injection attacks.
We conclude that these results show that the cosine similarity
matching approach is capable of detecting all attacks including
false data injection attack whereas the Chi-square based detector
is incapable of detecting false data injection attacks in the smart
grid. It is noted that once the attack is detected, system can take
preventive action and/or alarm the manager to take preventative
action to limit the risk.
V. CONCLUSION
In this letter, we have presented the Chi-square detector and
cosine similarity matching for attack detection in smart grid systems.
We have used Kalman filter estimation to find expected
measurements which are used to measure any deviation between
actual measurements and estimated values to detect attacks. We
have shown that both Chi-square detector and cosine similarity
matching are capable of detecting random attacks including denial-of-communication
attacks. The Chi-square detector was incapable
of detecting false data injection attacks, however, the
cosine similarity matching approach was able to detect false
data injection attacks. Once the attack is detected, system can
take preventive action and alarm the manager to take preventative
action to limit the risk. We have presented numerical results
obtained from simulations which corroborate our theoretical
analysis.
