Smart Grid Data Integrity Attacks

Abstract-Real power injections at loads and generators, and
real power flows on selected lines in a transmission network are
monitored and transmitted over a SCADA network to the system
operator. These are used in state estimation algorithms to make
dispatch, re-balance and other energy management system [EMS]
decisions. Coordinated cyber attacks on power meter readings can
be designed to be undetectable by any bad data detection algorithm.
These unobservable attacks present a serious threat to grid
operations. Of particular interest are sparse attacks that involve
the compromise of a modest number of meter readings. An efficient
algorithm to find all unobservable attacks [under standard
DC load flow approximations] involving the compromise of exactly
two power injection meters and an arbitrary number of power meters
on lines is presented. This requires flops for a power
system with buses and line meters. If all lines are metered,
there exist canonical forms that characterize all 3, 4, and 5-sparse
unobservable attacks. These can be quickly detected with
flops using standard graph algorithms. Known-secure phasor measurement
units [PMUs] can be used as countermeasures against a
given collection of cyber attacks. Finding the minimum number of
necessary PMUs is NP-hard. It is shown that PMUs at carefully
chosen buses are sufficient to neutralize a collection of cyber
attacks.

and inter-operate with new components [ex: smart meters], networks
[ex: NASPInet] [29], sensors [ex: phasor measurement
units or PMUs] [37], and control devices [ex: intelligent relays]
[30], [31]. Tomorrow's Smart Grid will incorporate increased
sensing, communication, and distributed control to accommodate
renewable generation, EV [Electric Vehicle] loads, storage,
and many other technologies. These innovations increase the
grid's vulnerability to cyber attacks, increasing the urgency and
relevance of cyber security research.
State estimation is a major component of Energy Management
Systems [1], [28]. This is the optimal estimation of the
power system state [voltage magnitudes and phase angles at
all buses] using [noisy] data from [real and reactive] power
meters, voltage sensors, and system parameters. We consider
data integrity cyber attacks that consist of a set of compromised
power meters whose readings are altered by the attacker. Cyberattacks
whose compromised meter readings are consistent with
the physical power flow constraints are called unobservable.
Unobservable
attacks require
coordination-compromised
meter readings must be carefully orchestrated to fall on a low
dimensional manifold in order for the attack to be unobservable.
Unobservable attacks will pass any bad data detection
algorithm. Such attacks can cause significant errors in state
estimation algorithms, which can mislead system operators into
making potentially catastrophic decisions. Liu et al. [25] have
recently shown that many power systems commonly admit
unobservable attacks involving a relatively small number of
power meters, and consequently the degree of coordination
necessary is modest. This surprising result has led to a flurry of
activity in the power system cybersecurity research community
[6], [20], [34], [35].
A. Summary of Contributions
We focus on unobservable low-sparsity cyber attacks that require
coordination of a small number of [ 5] meters. Indeed,
we suggest that cyber attacks of large numbers of meters are
improbable because of the degree of temporal coordination necessary
across geographically separated attack points. We provide
an efficient algorithm to find all unobservable attacks involving
the compromise of exactly two power injection meters
and an arbitrary number of power meters on lines. This requires
flops for a power system with
buses and
line meters.
For the special case, where all lines are metered, we derive
canonical forms for 3, 4, and 5-sparse unobservable attacks in
terms of the graph of the power network. We further show that
all -sparse attacks for
retic algorithms that require
can be found using graph-theoflops
to detect the presence
of these canonical forms for power systems with bounded degree
[i.e. max number of lines attached to a bus].
We next consider the problem of using known-secure PMUs
to thwart an arbitrary collection [not necessarily sparse] of

cyber attacks. We offer a characterization of buses at which
these PMUs must be placed to mitigate the collection of attacks.
Finding the minimum number of necessary PMUs is NP-hard
[3]. We show that it is sufficient to place PMUs at carefully
chosen buses to neutralize a collection of cyber attacks. We
offer an algorithm to determine this sufficient placement that
requires flops. We also offer countermeasures based
on state estimation without additional hardware. We conclude
with synthetic examples that illustrate our results.
We use the notion of topological observability for deriving
our results. Unobservable attacks can be characterized topologically.
As a result, they do not depend on power system line
electrical parameters or operating points. Consequently, our results
are not restricted to the linearized DC state estimation setting
but also hold for general nonlinear power flow models. The
complete development in the nonlinear setting is left for a future
paper.
B. Related Work
Many recent papers have explored various aspects of cyber
attacks on SCADA/EMS systems that impact the key function
of state estimation [5], [6], [20], [34], [35]. It was shown in
[20] that the attack strategy identified in [25] can be equivalently
characterized by the property that the power system becomes
unobservable by the removal of the compromised meters.
Fault detection is intimately connected to, but distinct from, integrity
attack detection. Recently, Gorinevski et al. [12] considered
a fault detection problem in SCADA/EMS systems that
is closely related to the problem formulation and approach of
[20]. Phasor measurement units have recently attracted a great
deal of interest for providing direct, low-latency state measurements.
Emami and Abur [9] have shown that with the introduction
of a few extra PMUs, the bad data detection capabilities
of a given system can be dramatically improved. More relevant
to our work is the recent paper of Bobba et al. [3] who have
investigated the use of PMUs in mitigation of SCADA/EMS
cyber attacks identified in [25] using heuristic algorithms. The
recent paper by Kim and Poor [19] also investigates optimal
PMU placement problems. Their approach is to use a greedy
PMU placement algorithm which suggests in simulation studies
that placing PMUs at 1/3 the number of nodes serves to protect
the system. Both papers recognize that the underlying placement
problem is NP-hard.
An early version without proofs of some of the results in this
paper was presented at the 2011 IEEE SmartGridComm [11].
II. PROBLEM SET-UP
The entry in the vector is . The vector, every component
of which is 1, is , and denotes the unit vector.
For a matrix , let and denote its range and null
spaces respectively. The transpose of is written . Subspaces
of R are written . Sets [of meters, buses, attacks]
are designated S V A. The number of elements in S is
written S , and V S denotes the set of elements in V that are
not in S.
Consider a power system consisting of buses, connected
by transmission lines. The power system can be represented as
1245
an undirected graph whose vertices V are the buses, and with
edge set E being the lines. Generators and loads are represented
by arcs entering or leaving a vertex.
There are two types of buses: injection buses where loads
or generators are connected, and null buses where no external
power is supplied or extracted. Transmission lines connect pairs
of buses. We combine all generation and loads at a bus into a
single injection, and we assume there is no more than one line
between any pair of buses. There are real power flow meters
on selected lines, and power injection meters to measure net injected
real power from all generators, and net power supplied
to all loads. As we will consider lossless DC load flow models,
other measurements [ex: real power flows at both ends of a line,
reactive power flows, etc.] are not immediately relevant to our
problem formulation. These become important for general nonlinear
load flow models. Today, real power meter data is acquired
every 2-10 seconds and transmitted to the EMS control
center over a legacy SCADA network. There is some consensus
that this SCADA network is vulnerable to cyber-attacks [17]. A
small fraction [ 10-15%] of lines have power flow meters, and
while all generators and loads are metered [for settlement], only
larger [ 50 MW] units have meters connected to the SCADA
network.
We consider a power system whose underlying graph is
simply connected. We make standard DC load flow assumptions:
quasi-steady state operation, all bus voltages are 1 p.u.,
the lines are lossless, and power angle differences are
small. We remark that these assumptions are made to simplify
our exposition. Indeed, some of the results of this paper [see Remark
15] are intimately connected to topological observability
[18] and therefore apply to the general case of nonlinear load
flow irrespective of operating condition. We designate an arbitrary
slack bus from which voltage phases are referenced.
Under these DC load flow assumptions, the power system state
is simply the bus angles relative to the slack bus R . In
standard practice, we disregard one of the injected power readings,
as the sum of power injections is zero to account for power
conservation. In our situation, we must depart from this practice
to allow for the possibility that power readings at any bus might
be compromised.
Let R be the vector of injected power measurements
at the buses. We order the buses so the first subset consists
of null buses, and the second subset consists of injection buses.
Thus has the form . Let R be the vector of
line power measurements. We can model the power system by
the linear equations:
R
(1)
Here, is constructed from line susceptances. We assume that
all susceptances are positive. With this assumption, we note that
the DC power flow model (1) does not admit real power flow
loops. The partition of [and ] corresponds to buses [null and
injection], and line meters respectively. We assume the system
state can be uniquely deduced [modulo translations] from the
injected power observations , or equivalently, .
A. Unobservable Attacks
Definition 1: An attack S is a set of meters S,
and an attack vector R . The nonzero components
of correspond to the compromised meters in S, i.e.
S . Under the attack , the meter readings
are changed by the attacker from their uncompromised values
to the compromised values . We abuse language and say
that a line is compromised when we mean that the meter on that
line is compromised. The sparsity of the attack is S the
number of compromised meters.
Definition 2: Consider a power system with the power flow
model (1). Let denote the current system state, and
denote the uncompromised measurements. An attack is
called unobservable at operating point with respect to the
model (1) if there exists some system state consistent with the
compromised observations, i.e.
Remark 3: Here is the (unique) perceived state perturbation
associated with attack . It is the fictitious change of
system state necessary to produce the compromised meter readings
. As model (1) is linear, S is unobservable
if and only if , is solvable, and S indexes the
nonzero elements of . Unobservability of under the model
(1) does not depend on the current system state .
Remark 4: Consider an unobservable attack S . Let
M denote set of all meters, indexed , and let
T M S be the complement of S. We can conduct elementary
row permutations (or re-index power meters) to write
Here the matrices and are formed from by deleting the
rows in S and by retaining the rows in S respectively. Note that
every element of the vector is nonzero. This representation will
be useful in the sequel.
The next result follows immediately from [20].
Theorem 5: Consider the DC power flow model (1). Consider
an unobservable attack S . Construct the matrices
and from by deleting the rows in S and by retaining the
rows in S respectively. Then

the rows of to write
This establishes (b). Also, , which forces

is an admissible attack vector. This is because we also require
that every entry of be nonzero.

defined by the equivalence classes
Unobservable attacks require a high degree of coordination.
The attack vector must be carefully orchestrated across spatially
separated meters, and the attacker must have access to
the model. This necessary coordination suggests that low sparsity
attacks are more probable as they involve compromising a
small number of meters. Low sparsity attacks have been studied
in [25], [35].
B. Observable Islands
With every unobservable attack, we can associate a set of observable
islands. This graph-theoretic construct is central to the
results in this paper. Observable islands are disjoint subsets of
buses, which share the same perceived change of state [voltage
phase] under the attack. More precisely:
Definition 6: Let S be an unobservable attack, and
let be its associated perceived change of system state. Partition
the set of buses V into the disjoint union
V
The sets V are called the observable islands associated
with the attack .
Remark 7: We can now offer a geometric picture of unobservable
attacks. If an attack is unobservable, it must be consistent
with the underlying model, and thus corresponds to a perceived
perturbation in power flow. All non-zero power flows
in this perturbed power flow correspond either to compromised
sensors or unmetered lines. This perturbation must satisfy power
conservation at each bus. It is characterized by the perceived
bus phase perturbations . All buses within an observable island
have the same perceived voltage angle perturbation, and
therefore perceived power flow perturbations on lines entirely
within any observable island are identically zero. None of meters
on these lines could have been compromised. Conversely,
any line connecting two distinct observable islands has a phase
difference across it, and must therefore have non-zero perceived
power flow perturbation. All such lines must either have compromised
meters or be unmetered. This observable island characterization
is central to our exposition.
Theorem 8: Consider the unobservable attack S .
(a) Every compromised line in S connects distinct observable
islands.
(b) Every line that connects distinct observable islands is either
unmetered or compromised.
(c) No lines contained within an observable island are compromised.
Proof: Under attack , we will have perceived real power
flow perturbations from bus to bus , and bus phase perturbations
at bus .
(a) If the line connecting buses and is compromised,
and this requires . Thus, buses must fall
in distinct observable islands.
(b) If a line connects buses from distinct observable islands,
we must have which forces .
This implies that the meter on that line is compromised or
that the line is unmetered.
GIANI et al.: SMART GRID DATA INTEGRITY ATTACKS
(c) Any line connecting buses within an observable island
has which implies . As a result, this
line cannot have been compromised.
Remark 9: Fix an unobservable attack S . Its associated
observable islands can be found by solving
for the state , and placing buses into equivalence classes according
to Definition 6. This requires flops and is numerically
sensitive. If all lines are metered, Theorem 8 suggests
a robust graph-theoretic algorithm to calculate all connected
components corresponding to the observable islands of
: (a) Start with the power system graph , and delete all compromised
lines indexed in S. (b) The observable islands are
the resulting connected components of the reduced graph. All
connected components of a graph can be found in
time using standard breadth-first or depth-first search algorithms
[14]. The observable islands of do not depend on transmission
line parameters. They are derived from the interconnection
structure of the power system graph. We do not have a
graph-theoretic method of constructing observable islands in the
case that all lines are not metered. The easiest way appears to be
linear algebraic. Solve for the state perturbation
and place buses accordingly in equivalent classes. This method
is not robust and suffers from noise issues. Indeed, it may be
worth while exploring other notions of islands to allow for small
[non-zero] power flow within an island. This is a subject of further
research and beyond the scope of this paper.
III. CHARACTERIZATIONS OF SPARSE ATTACKS
We now characterize irreducible attacks, and offer an algorithm
to find all irreducible attacks that involve the compromise
of exactly two power injection meters. We then derive canonical
forms for all 3-, 4-, and 5-sparse attacks under the assumption
that all lines are metered.
A. Irreducible Attacks
Definition 10: An attack S is called irreducible
if it is unobservable and there is no unobservable attack
S with S S.
We will need the following:
Lemma 11: Let S be an irreducible attack. Construct
the matrices and from by deleting the rows in S
and by retaining the rows in S respectively. Then,
Proof: Assume S is irreducible. Without loss of
generality, we can permute the rows of to write
Suppose there exists such that

of exactly two power injection meters and an arbitrary number of line meters.
B. Attacks Involving 2 Power Injection Meters
Finding all possible irreducible attacks is equivalent to
finding minimal sets of rows of whose deletion reduces
by one (see Theorem 12). This is a computationally
intractable problem even for small power networks. Cyberattacks
involving large numbers of meters are improbable
because of the degree of temporal coordination necessary
across geographically separated attack points. We therefore
focus on low-sparsity cyber-attacks that require coordination
of a small number of meters.
We first consider irreducible attacks involving the compromise
of exactly two power injection meters and an arbitrary
number of power meters on lines. Theorem 12 immediately suggests
an efficient algorithm offered in Fig. 1 to find all such attacks.
Our algorithm uses certain linear algebraic manipulations
that bear some resemblance to the procedure in [21] to find all
critical measurement sets in the context of power system observability.
The algorithm exploits the following observations. Consider
the DC power flow model (1). As the system is assumed observable,
. Using elementary column operations, we
can write the power flow model as
.

All entries of the row are 1, because the sum of
injected powers is zero for all states . We seek minimal sets
of rows of [two injection meters and an arbitrary number
of lines] whose deletion reduces its rank by one. For example,
deleting the first two rows of leaves
For this matrix to have rank , we must further delete all line
meter rows where . The complete algorithm is offered
in Fig. 1.
This algorithm requires flops for a power system
with buses and line meters. For the CAISO 4000 bus
system, this can be done in approximately 1 minute on a 3 Ghz
PC. The technique can be recursively extended to irreducible attacks
involving power injection meters, but the algorithm
complexity is which is disheartening. The
attack vector , which is also specified in the algorithm, must
lie in a 1-dimensional subspace as identified in Theorem 12.
C. Canonical Forms
In some future reality, we can imagine that all lines on the
transmission network are instrumented with power meters.
In this situation, we can offer a graph theoretic characterization
of 3-, 4-, and 5-sparse attacks. A bridge is an edge whose
deletion increases the number of connected components in a
graph. We have the following:
Theorem 13: Assume all lines are metered. An irreducible
attack S is 3-sparse if and only if
(a) S consists of two adjacent injection buses and the
line connecting these buses, and
(b) The connecting line is a bridge of the power system
graph .
Proof: Let be a 3-sparse irreducible attack. This corresponds
to some perceived perturbation in power flow (see Remark
7). As this power flow must have a source and a sink,
two distinct injection buses must be compromised. These
buses must be in distinct observable islands. There must exist
some path from to along which the perceived power flows.
As all lines are metered, every edge on that path must be compromised.
Since is 3-sparse, this path can contain only one
edge, i.e. the third compromised sensor must be on a line connecting
. If there are other lines connecting these islands,
GIANI et al.: SMART GRID DATA INTEGRITY ATTACKS
they must also be compromised (see Theorem 8). As only three
sensors are compromised, no such line can exist, which forces
to be a bridge. Sufficiency is evident from construction.
Theorem 14: Assume all lines are metered. An irreducible
attack S is 4-sparse if and only if
(a) S consists of two injection buses and two lines
.
(b) The injection buses are connected by the lines
via an intermediate bus .
(c) The connecting lines are bridges of the power
system graph .
Proof: Let be a 4-sparse irreducible attack. This corresponds
to some perceived perturbation in power flow (see Remark
7). As this power flow must have a source and a sink, two
injection buses must be compromised. Since perceived
power flows from to [or vice-versa], these buses must be
in distinct islands. Since the system graph is connected, there
must be at least 1 line connecting these islands. This line must
also be compromised as all lines are assumed metered. Since
is 4-sparse, exactly one other meter must be compromised. If
this is an injection meter, it must be at a bus distinct from
as we assume there is at most one injection meter at any
bus. Since perceived power must flow from or to , at least one
other line meter must be compromised, making have sparsity
5. Thus, exactly two distinct injection buses and two
lines are compromised.
All paths that carry nonzero perceived power must connect
and as these are the only compromised injection nodes. As all
lines are metered, every edge on these paths must be compromised.
Since is 4-sparse, these paths contain exactly 2 edges
in total. Thus at most two such paths exist. If there were two
paths, these contain distinct singleton edges connecting .
This possibility is precluded by our assumption that there is no
more than one line between any pair of buses. Thus the perceived
power must flow from to on a single path containing
exactly two compromised lines . Label the intermediate
bus . This could be a null bus or an uncompromised injection
bus.
Finally, the buses must fall in distinct observable
islands as perceived power flows between these buses. Lines
or connect these islands. If there are other lines connecting
these islands, they must also be compromised (see Theorem 8).
As only 4 sensors are compromised, no such lines can exist,
which forces to be bridges. Sufficiency is evident from
construction.
Theorems 13 and 14 essentially offer canonical forms for 3and
4-sparse irreducible attacks. A more succinct representation
of these canonical forms is shown in Fig. 2. Every 3- and
4-sparse irreducible attack must have the structure captured in
these canonical forms. For 5-sparse attacks, there are three possible
canonical forms, and these are shown in Fig. 3. Armed
with these canonical forms, we can readily parse a power system
graph to detect the presence of low sparsity unobservable attacks.
This involves standard depth-first search methods [7] to
find minimal cut-sets. For example, [33] offers a algorithm
to find all bridges in a graph. Finding cut-sets consisting
of 2 edges [as found in two of the 5-sparse canonical forms] can
be done by deleting edges and searching for bridges.
1249
Fig. 2. Canonical forms: 3-sparse (left) & 4-sparse (right) irreducible attacks.
Fig. 3. Three canonical forms for 5-sparse irreducible attacks.
Remark 15: These canonical forms for sparse attacks depend
only on the topological properties on the power system graph.
Indeed, the current operating point and bus admittance parameters
play no role. As a result, these canonical forms represent
attacks that are irreducible with respect to a complete nonlinear
power system model. The attack vector itself must lie on
a one-dimensional manifold [as opposed to a subspace for the
linear DC power flow model (1)].
IV. COUNTERMEASURES
A. Countermeasures Using Known-Secure PMUs
Consider an arbitrary [not necessarily sparse] collection A
of unobservable attacks. We now consider countermeasures
against attacks in A by placing known-secure phase measurement
units [PMUs] at certain buses to render these attacks
observable. A PMU placed at bus offers direct measurement
of the voltage phase at that bus. PMU's are networked on
the newer NASPInet architecture which has been designed for
secure data transfer. As a result, attacks that compromise PMU
data are much less likely than those that target power meters on
the legacy SCADA network. This justifies our assumption of
known-secure PMUs. We begin with the following:
Theorem 16: Consider an arbitrary collection of unobservable
attacks A . Let
V
V
V
denote the observable islands associated with attack .
All attacks in A can be made observable by placing PMUs at
buses B
V
B
V
B
i.e. every attack has two distinct islands which contain PMUs.
Proof: Consider the observable islands V V associated
with attack . If attack occurs, all observable islands
1250
IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID, VOL. 4, NO. 3, SEPTEMBER 2013
must have pair-wise distinct phases. By placing PMUs at buses
in any two distinct islands, we can monitor their voltage phase
difference, rendering attack observable.
Finding the minimal number of PMUs necessary to make the
attacks in A observable is equivalent to the following set-theoretic
problem: Given a collection Q Q
of sets, find the minimal set B, such that Q B for all
. This is known as the hitting set problem [see [36],
p. 451], which is known to be NP-hard. We are able to offer a
clean upper bound on the minimal number of PMUs required,
and offer an algorithm to determine their placement:
Theorem 17: Consider any collection A
of unobservable attacks. There exists a set B containing
buses with the following property: if direct measurements of the
voltage phase angles at all buses B are available, then the
collection of attacks A becomes observable.
Proof: We construct the set of buses B at which we place
PMUs. Select any buses drawn from distinct observable
islands V and V associated with for inclusion in B. This
choice renders observable from Theorem 16. Consider the
observable islands associated with attack :
V
V
V
As the union of these islands contains all buses, we must have
V for some index . Select any bus V ,
for inclusion in B. By construction, we have placed PMUs in
two distinct observable islands associated with . Next, consider
the observable islands of attack . Again, we must have
V for some index . Select any bus V ,
for inclusion in B. PMUs at and render observable. We
continue in this fashion and select buses for inclusion
in B. This collection of PMUs makes all the attacks in A
observable, proving the claim.
Heuristic procedures can be used to reduce the number of
PMUs necessaryto render A observable. A greedy algorithm for
this was proposed in [3]. The placement algorithm of [19] suggests
in simulation studies that it requires placing PMUs at about
1/3 the total number of buses to protect the system. We offer an
alternative method that exploits the underlying observable island
structure. The idea is to select buses at each iteration from
the smallest observable island. Intuitively, this process is likely
to place PMUs that are common to many islands. Our algorithm
is detailed in Fig. 4.
B. Countermeasures Based on State-Estimation
We now offer a countermeasure strategy based on state-estimation
that does not require any hardware investment. It is
of use to detect large unobservable attacks where the measurements
are compromised at a time scale much faster than the
native rate at which loads and generation vary. The essential
idea is as follows. Let denote the trajectory of voltage
phases. Under normal system operation is a slowly varying
signal. At the time-scales we are concerned with, we can write
. Suppose we have an unobservable attack ,
which commences at time . Let V V denote the observable
islands of . Define . Under normal operating
conditions, for a short time interval after the attack
We can declare an arbitrary slack bus , which we place in V .
Therefore, we observe [equivalently] that for ,

commences. Consider any island V , and designate an arbitrary
reference bus V . For all other buses V , the phase differences
, . Equivalently, the voltage
angles at all buses within an island translate in unison after an
attack. For example, suppose we have two observable islands
V and V . The voltage angles [prior to the attack] are roughly
constant. After the attack, two groups of bus angles evolve together,
i.e. for we have
where . If V is large, this event of bus
angles translating in unison is improbable under normal system
operation.
In the general case, we will have a collection of observable islands.
After an attack, the voltage angles translate in unison for
each island. We place the slack bus in the largest island. State estimation
will reveal that collections of states in the other islands
translate in union. Define of the second largest
island. If , we would observe states of all other [singleton]
islands translating, which will not raise any alarms. If
however, is large, say 10, we would observe the states
of ten buses translating in union. Thus, is a natural measure
of detectability of the attack. Attacks with very large are
easily detected. Further research based on change-point detection
methods [2] is required to establish a connection between
and the latency of detecting the attack.
V. EXAMPLES
A. 6-bus Illustrative Example
We begin with a synthetic 6-bus example to illustrate unobservable
attacks, perceived power flows, the associated observable
islands, and our counter measure strategy using known-secure
PMUs. Buses 2 and 5 are generator buses, while buses 1, 3,

4, and 6 are loads. All line admittances are identical. The generation
at bus 5 is less expensive. All power injections/extractions
and all line flows are metered. The power flows before the
attack are shown in Fig. 5. At a certain time, an attacker compromises
the line meter reading on line (3, 4) and the power
extraction readings at loads 3, 4. This is done in a coordinated
fashion so the perceived flows are consistent with the DC power
flow model. This consistency renders the attack unobservable.
The perceived power flows after the attack are shown in Fig. 6
[only the values that change are shown]. The perceived power
flow perturbation is a 50 MW flow from bus 4 to bus 3 along the
tie-line (3,4). There are two observable islands: V
and V . Notice that there is no perceived power
flow entirely within any observable island. The system operator
estimates the voltage phase angles at all buses before and after
the attack. These are tabulated in Table I. Observe that the perceived
angle changes are approximately constant within any island.
Placing two secure PMUs at a pair of buses, one in each
island, will serve as a countermeasure. The recorded phase difference
between these PMUs in distinct islands will be zero

which is in conflict with the state estimation results, alerting the
system operator to this attack.
B. Irreducible Attacks
We have run our algorithm for finding all irreducible attacks
involving exactly two injection meters [see Fig. 1] on the 300,
2383, and 2746 IEEE Bus Test Cases. We have done this in two
cases: (a) all lines are metered, (b) 20% of the lines [chosen at
random] are metered. In each case, we have found the number of
2, 3, and 4 sparse attacks, and an upper bound on the number of
PMUs necessary to render these attacks observable. PMUs were
placed using our heuristic algorithm [see Fig. 4]. Our results are
tabulated below.
From these limited studies, we see that power systems are
vulnerable to many sparse unobservable attacks. If only some
lines are metered, the number of possible attacks can increase
substantially. Sparse attacks can be found quickly, and countermeasures
can be developed using known-secure PMUs. These
examples suggest that PMUs are needed to render the
collection of attacks observable. This is approximately half the
sufficient number of PMUs used in the placement algorithm of
Theorem 17. For instance, in the 2383 test case with all lines metered,
we have identified 480 unobservable attacks with sparsity
4. Our heuristic algorithm of Fig. 4 places PMUs at 232 select
buses to render this collection of attacks observable, while

C. State Estimation Based Countermeasures
Fig. 7 shows a 19 bus portion of the IEEE 300 bus test case
that is particularly prone to unobservable attacks. If all lines and
all injection buses were metered then this 19 bus test case would
be prone to six 5-sparse, twelve 4-sparse, and four 3-sparse attacks.
In particular, we examine the 3-sparse attack that involves
injection buses 9021 and 9002. This attack has two observable
islands, one containing 5 buses and the other containing
295 buses. The attack begins at , and the attacker
gradually increases the amplitude of the attack at 3 MW/sec to
evade detection. Fig. 8 shows the state evolution. Notice that
two groups of voltage angles [corresponding to the observable
islands] evolve in unison. The perceived angle perturbations in
the 5 bus island are zero because the [arbitrary] slack bus is contained
in this island. This event alerts the system operator of the
attack without the investment of additional PMUs.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we have introduced and characterized irreducible
cyberattacks. We have offered an efficient algorithm
to find all irreducible attacks that involve the compromise of
exactly two power injection meters. We have derived canonical
forms for all 3-, 4-, and 5-sparse attacks under the assumption
that all lines are metered. We have offered countermeasures
against arbitrary unobservable attacks using known-secure
PMUs, and shown that PMUs are sufficient to disable
attacks.
A significant difficulty in state estimation is the stale data
problem. Meter readings arrive asynchronously at the state estimator,
and the worst case delay may be on the order of 5-10
minutes [including algorithm convergence time]. With such latencies,
state estimation may be a poor vehicle to detect cyberattacks.
The deeper issue with cybersecurity research relates to
grid operations. An attack has consequences only when the grid
operator is misled into taking harmful actions based on the compromised
data. A comprehensive and realistic analysis of cybersecurity
threats to electricity grids must therefore incorporate
current operating practice, both under normal and contingency
operations. These issues are worthy of future research.
