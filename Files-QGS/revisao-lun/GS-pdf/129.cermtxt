On False Data-Injection Attacks against Power
System State Estimation: Modeling
and Countermeasures

Abstract-It is critical for a power system to estimate its operation state based on meter measurements in the field and the
configuration of power grid networks. Recent studies show that the adversary can bypass the existing bad data detection schemes,
posing dangerous threats to the operation of power grid systems. Nevertheless, two critical issues remain open: 1) how can an
adversary choose the meters to compromise to cause the most significant deviation of the system state estimation, and 2) how can a
system operator defend against such attacks? To address these issues, we first study the problem of finding the optimal attack
strategy-i.e., a data-injection attacking strategy that selects a set of meters to manipulate so as to cause the maximum damage. We
formalize the problem and develop efficient algorithms to identify the optimal meter set. We implement and test our attack strategy on
various IEEE standard bus systems, and demonstrate its superiority over a baseline strategy of random selections. To defend against
false data-injection attacks, we propose a protection-based defense and a detection-based defense, respectively. For the protectionbased
defense, we identify and protect critical sensors and make the system more resilient to attacks. For the detection-based
defense, we develop the spatial-based and temporal-based detection schemes to accurately identify data-injection attacks.

INTRODUCTION
Aintegrates a physical power transmission system with
S a typical cyber-physical system (CPS), the power grid
the cyber computation and communication core [1]. It
supplies electric power from generators through power
transmission and distribution networks to large geographical
areas. The development of a next-generation power
grid, i.e., the smart grid, has received significant attention
recently [2].
State estimation has been widely used by Energy
Management Systems (EMS) at the control center to ensure
that the power grid is running in desired states. It provides
the estimation of system states in real time based on meter
measurements in the field. The meter measurements are
collected by the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition

(SCADA) Systems and processed by a state estimator to filter
the measurement noise and to detect gross errors. The
results of state estimation are then used by applications at
the control center, for purposes such as contingency
analysis, optimal power flow, economic dispatch, and
others [3]. One can see that state estimation plays a critical
role in the stability of power grid systems.
Meter measurements collected via the SCADA system
contain not only measurement noise due to the finite
accuracy of meters and communication media, but also
errors caused by various issues-for example, meters with
faulty connection and calibration. To reduce the impact of
noise and errors, power system researchers have developed
numerous methods to process meter measurements after
the state estimation process [4], [5], [6]. The essential goal of
these methods is to leverage the redundancy of multiple
measurements to identify and remove anomalies.
While most existing techniques for protecting power grid
systems were designed to ensure system reliability (i.e.,
against random failures), recently there have been growing
concerns in smart grid initiatives on the protection against
malicious cyber attacks [7], [8], [9]. There are growing
concerns in the smart grid on protection against malicious
cyber threats and the operation and control of smart grid
depend on a complex cyberspace of computers, software,
and communication technologies [10], [11]. Because the
measurement component supported by smart equipment
(e.g., smart meters and sensors) plays an important role, it
can be a target for attacks. As those measuring devices may
be connected through open network interfaces and lacking
tamper-resistance hardware increases the possibility of
being compromised by the adversary. For example, Stuxnet

is the first publicly known malware to exploit vulnerabilities
in SCADA systems [12]. With compromised devices in
the grid, the adversary can inject false measurement reports
to the controller. This causes the controller to estimate
wrong system states, posing dangerous threats to the
operation of the power grid system.
False data-injection attack were proposed by Liu et al.
[8], [13]. In such attacks, the adversary could attack the state
of a power grid system. Their proposed approach could
bypass existing bad data detection schemes and arbitrarily
manipulate the state estimation of grid systems, posing
damage on the operation of power grid. As such, in this
attack, the goal of the adversary is to mislead power
operation, the methodology used by the adversary is to
compromise meters and inject data, and the consequence of
such attacks is to let malicious data pass traditional bad
data detection, posing the negative impact on many
applications based on state estimation. In addition to the
attack against static state estimation, false data-injection
attacks can be used to attack other key functional modules
in the smart grid such as energy price, distributed energy
distribution, and others.
In this paper, we study a novel problem of defending
against false data-injection attacks from the system operator's
point of view. Because most adversaries are limited in
the amount of resources they possess, we first consider a
least-effort attack model-i.e., the objective of the adversary
is to identify the minimum number of meters that one has to
manipulate to change a predetermined number of state
variables (so as to launch a false data-injection attack
accordingly). We prove the NP-hardness of this problem by
reduction from the minimum subadditive join problem.
To address this problem in a practical setting, we
develop a linear transformation-based approach, which
finds the optimal solution through the matrix transformation.
Nevertheless, the computation complexity of the
matrix transformation grows exponentially with the size
of the power network. To address this issue, we develop a
heuristic yet extremely efficient approach. Specifically,
through the analysis of the H matrix, for a set of bus state
variables, the adversary needs to compromise less meters
when the buses are connected to one another with the
largest degrees and connected to the least number of buses
beyond its area. Based on this insight, we divide the
network into a number of overlapping areas. The linear
transformation or brute-force search (BF) can be used to
identify the optimal set of meters for individual small areas
and then derive the set of meters for the whole network. We
have implemented our proposed heuristic-based approach
on power system state manipulation on various IEEE
standard buses. Our extensive experimental data validate
the feasibility and effectiveness of the developed approach.
Since the false data-injection attacks may successfully
change the state variables by manipulating sensor measurements
based on the knowledge of the system topological
information, there are two ways for the system operator to
develop countermeasures. One is to make some of the
critical sensors more resilient to attacks. In practice, when a
power grid system contains thousands of meters and covers
a large area, the cost of protecting all meters can be very
high. For the protection-based defense, we identify the
critical meters to protect based on the false data-injection
model. Our experimental data show the superiority of our
approach over the random selection of meters to protect.
The other is to develop the anomaly detection mechanisms
to recognize false data-injection attacks. To continually
manipulate the power grid state estimation causing extensive
damage such as disrupting the contingency analysis
and others, the adversary will need to manipulate measurements
from a set of sensors over time. Hence, we design
spatial and temporal-based detection algorithms in the
control center to identify stealthy attacks. Our developed
spatial-based detection algorithm is designed by leveraging
the fact that when we view all the measurements received
at a certain time as a unity spatially, the accumulated
deviation of all the marginally compromised measurements
will be significant. To detect false data-injection attacks that
manipulate sensor measurements over time, we develop the
temporal-based detection algorithm based on the nonparametric
cumulative sum (cusum) change detection technique.
We implement our proposed detection algorithms and test
their performance using the IEEE 14-bus system. Our
experimental data show that the spatial-based detection
algorithm is able to recognize at least 95 percent of the false
data-injection attacks once the attack changes more than
6 percent of the state variable values. Our experimental data
also show that the temporal-based detection algorithm can
identify the compromised meters that send manipulated
measurements quickly. In comparison with the conference
version of this work [14] that is only five pages, this
extended journal version contains substantial new materials,
including new attack and countermeasure methods and
evaluation, theoretical analytical results, and others.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: We
introduce the background of state estimation and false
data-injection attacks in Section 2. In Section 3, we model
the least-effort attack, which effectively computes the
minimal set of meter measurements given the number of
state variables to manipulate and present the hierarchical
false data-injection attack strategy. In Section 4, we develop
countermeasures against false data-injection attacks. In
Section 5, we present our experimental results of the
least-effort attack and countermeasures. In Section 6, we
review the related work. Finally, we conclude the paper in
Section 7.

PRELIMINARIES
In this section, we first discuss the state estimation of power
grid systems and then review the state-of-the-art false datainjection
attack proposed in [8]. The system we focus on in
this paper is actually the power transmission system-i.e., a
network or power grid consisting of generators, transformers,
and transmission lines and devices. The state
estimator in the control center [15] uses the steady system
model and data reported from a SCADA system to estimate
the system state-for example, the phasor voltages at all
buses-over the time. Here, “buses” can be generators,
loads or transformers in a power grid system. Each meter is
supposed to collect sensing measurements in the field and
report them to the control center. The control center then

uses the collected measurements to estimate the state
variables of power grid networks. Generally speaking, the
state estimation can be formalized by
z ¼ hðxÞ þ e:
ð1Þ
Here, z ¼ ðz1; z2; . . . ; zmÞT represents the measurement
vector. Examples of zi 2 IR (i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; m) include bus
voltages Vi, bus active and reactive power flows Pi; Qi, and
branch active and reactive power flows Pij; Qij of the power
system. x ¼ ðx1; x2; . . . ; xnÞT represents the state vector, xj 2
IR (j ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n) can be the bus voltage magnitudes Vi and
phase angles i of the system buses. e ¼ ðe1; e2; . . . ; emÞT
represents the measurement error vector, (ek 2 IR (k ¼ 1;
2; . . . ; m), which is a zero-mean variable in Gaussian
distribution). Let covðeiÞ ¼ i2; covðeÞ ¼ R.
We notice that h x
ð Þ is a nonlinear vector function
derived from the network topology. If the sensor measurements
are based on the branch and bus power flows, the
function can be derived by Pij ¼ vXivijj sinð i jÞ þ e, and
Pi ¼ Pj2@i Pij þ e, where Pij is the active power flow from
bus i to bus j, Pi is the active power injection at bus i, i and
j represent the phase angles of buses i and j, respectively,
vi is the bus i's voltage magnitude, Xij denotes the
reactance, and @i represents the set of buses connected to
bus i.
In this paper, we focus on the DC-state estimation model,
in which the bus voltage magnitudes are already known
and is equal to 1 per unit, and all shunt elements, bus and
branch and reactive power flow can be ignored. Note that
there is 1 meter on each bus measuring its real power
injection and 2 meters on each transmission line measuring
the line real power flows [3]. Then, above equations can be
linearized and rewritten by
Pij ¼
i
Xij
j :
ð2Þ
Hence, for a DC-state estimation model, (1) can be
simplified by a linear model and we have z ¼ Hx þ e,
where the measurement matrix Hm n is a constant Jacobian
matrix. For a system with N buses, if we choose bus 1 as the
reference bus, i.e., 1 ¼ 0, the state vector in DC model
becomes x ¼ ð 2; 3; . . . ; N ÞT .
In a DC-state estimation procedure, the number of sensor
measurements is normally larger than that of the state
variables ðm > nÞ. Redundant measurements are used to
improve the accuracy of state estimation. In particular, the
objective of weighted least square (WLS) state estimation is
to find x^ and minimize JðxÞ ¼ ðz Hx^ÞTR 1ðz Hx^Þ.
Then, x^ can be derived by x^ ¼ ðHTR 1HÞ 1HTR 1z.
In false data-injection attacks, the adversary who has the
knowledge of the network configuration of power grid (e.g.,
topology) can inject some of meter readings and manipulate
the state variables arbitrarily. Different from the classic
“unintentional” bad data case, this type of malicious attacks
can effectively bypass the bad data detection. The main idea
of false data-injection attack is to add a nonzero attack
vector a ¼ ða1; a2; . . . ; amÞT to the original sensor measurements
vector z. The observed sensor measurements vector
becomes za ¼ z þ a. The control center receives this
manipulated vector and uses it to derive false estimates
x^bad. Let x^bad ¼ x^ þ c, x^ be the original estimates and let c
be the malicious errors added to the original estimates. Liu
et al. [8] investigated an attack strategy, which can bypass
the existing bad data test based on the principle, in which
a 2 ImðHÞ, i.e., a ¼ Hc. The following analysis shows the
feasibility of this false data-injection attack:

LEAST-EFFORT FALSE DATA-INJECTION ATTACK
In this section, we first present the formalization of the
least-effort attack, which enables the adversary to find the
sparsest attack vector a so that the attack can be conducted
with the least effort by compromising the minimal
necessary number of sensors. We then describe a linear
transformation-based approach, which is capable of generating
the optimal solution, albeit only computationally
feasible for small networks. Finally, we present our
heuristic-based approach for large grid networks in an
efficient fashion.
3.1 Problem Formulation
We assume that the number of manipulated state variables
is limited to kðk < nÞ. The adversary needs to find the
sparsest attack vector a that satisfies the relation a ¼ Hc.
The least-effort attack can be formulated by
ð4Þ
mcin kHck0;
s:t:kck0 ¼ k:
Liu et al. [8] obtained an approximate boundary of
kHck0. In particular, they conducted experiments on IEEE
standard bus systems. They first randomly chose kð1
k 10Þ state variables and injected malicious data (e.g.,
100 times larger than the real estimates of the state
variables) into each of them and then examined the
number meters that need to be compromised. For a given
k, they conducted the above experiment 1,000 times to
examine the distribution of kHck0. As an example, when
injecting the malicious data into 10 state variables, [8,
Fig. 6] shows that the adversary needs to compromise 60140
meter measurements for the IEEE 118-bus system, and
50-140 meter measurements for the IEEE 300-bus system.
As we can see, one issue remains open: how can an
adversary choose the meters to compromise to cause the
most significant deviation of the system state estimation?
We address this issue and study the false data-injection
attack with the least effort.
Given k state variables to manipulate, let ¼ fi1,
i2; . . . ; ikg, g be the number of sensor measurements to
compromise, the computation of g is showed in Theorem 1.
Theorem 1. Assume that the attack vector a ¼ Hc, ci1 ¼ ci2 ¼
¼ cik 6¼ 0, ¼ fi1; i2; . . . ; ikg. The number of nonzero
elements in a can be derived by
g ¼ k þ 3 X

where @i (the buses adjacent to bus i) is divided into two parts:
one is Pi which satisfies Pi
and the other is Qi-i.e.,
buses, which does not belong to . ri represents the number of
buses connected to bus i and jðj 2
; j > iÞ at the same time
and q represents the number of buses that jQij ¼ 0 in .
Proof. The measurement matrix H is a constant Jacobian
matrix, which depends on (1), that is, Hij ¼ @@xzij .
In the measurement vector z, the first n elements
is denoted as the active power flows at buses 1; 2; . . . ; n,
and the rest m
n elements are active power flows from
bus i to bus j. We know that every row sum of H is 0, as
well as its column sum. Thus, for the buses j 2 @i and
k 62 @i, we have Hij, which is equal to

Let H ¼ ðh1; h2; . . . ; hmÞ , where hi is denoted as the
ith row vector of H. Equations (6) and (7) indicate that
hiði ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; nÞ has j@ij þ 1 nonzero elements, which
are Hii and Hij. We note that hiði ¼ n þ 1; 2; . . . ; mÞ has

We can see for a power grid network, H is a very
sparse matrix, and each of its last ðm

two opposite numbers. This is because the last ðm
rows are determined by (7). For example, if bus i

respectively, and a ¼ Hc, the ith and jth elements of
both hk and hl will be two opposite numbers. Hence, if
we set ci ¼ cj, we have ak ¼ al ¼ 0. In the same way, if
bus i also connects to bus t and ci ¼ ct, two
elements of the attack vector a will be 0. That is to say,

From the above analysis, we know that the least-effort

The complexity of obtaining the optimal solution is

Theorem 2. When c

finding optimal sensor measurement for the least-effort attack
in the DC-state estimation is NP-hard.
Proof. Notice that the problem for the least-effort attack is to
compute a c with k nonzero elements so that a has the
least number of nonzero elements for a given H. In other
words, we need to find k columns from
H, which
minimizes the number of nonzero elements in a. We can
transform the above problem to the Minimum Subadditive
Join problem [16], which is NP-hard.
Generally speaking, the Minimum Subadditive Join
problem can be described as follows: let ðL; Þ be a
semilattice and let c : L ! ½0; 1Þ be

The transformation works in the following way: we
first choose a subcollection X ¼ ð1; 2; . . . ; nÞ of L. Then,

By now, the least-effort attack problem in Theorem 1
has been transformed to the Minimum Subadditive Join

Minimum Subadditive Join problem is

problem, which is NP-hard. Hence, we can say
the MSJ problem is NP-hard and details can be found in
[16]. We know that the least-effort attack problem is NPhard
as well.

From the above results, we conclude that to obtain the
optimal g for k state variables, the adversary should search
n
ðkÞ combinations of state variables. Equation (5) can be
used to compute g
for each fixed set of state variables.
Ultimately, the global optimal one g
should be the
minimum value of all combinations.
3.2
Linear Transformation-Based Approach
The least-effort attack stated in Section 3.1 is to find an
attack vector a that contains the least number of nonzero
elements. Recall that a 2 ImðHÞ-i.e., a is a linear combination
of the column vectors of H. We now develop a linear
transformation-based approach to construct the optimal
attack vector, the main idea of which is illustrated in the
following Theorem.
Theorem 3. After each column exchange of HT , there will be a
new matrix. We can obtain the new matrix's row simplest
form1 by elementary matrix transformation. The optimal
solution of the problem (denoted as a ) is in one of the row
simplest form.
Proof. We assume the optimal solution a exists and it has
d nonzero elements. Because a
is also a linear
combination of the row vectors of HT , HT could be
transformed to the following form (denoted as ðHT Þ0 ) by
row transformation:
transformed ðHT Þ0 is
where 1; . . . ; n 1 are m-dimensional row vectors. We
then make some column exchanges for ðHT Þ0 to make all
the nonzero elements in ða ÞT in the last d columns. The
ð10Þ
ð11Þ
We now transform the matrix composed of first ðn
vectors of ðHT Þ00 to row simplest form through elementary
row transformation, and then use Reduction and Reduc1
Þ
tion to Absurdity to prove that ðHT Þ00 is the row simplest
form. We first assume that ðHT Þ00 is not row simplest
form. Because if ðHT Þ00 is not row simplest form while the
matrix composed of first ðn
simplest form, there must exit a vector in
1Þ vectors of ðHT Þ00 is row
01; . . . ; 0n 1, the
T
column subscript of the first nonzero elements of which is
larger than that of ða Þ . Then, a could not be the vector,
which contains the least number of nonzero elements. This
is contrary to our previous assumption: ðHT Þ00 is not the
row simplest form. Hence, ðHT Þ00 is the row simplest form.
1. Notice that the row simplest form has the characteristics that the first
nonzero element of every nonzero row is 1, and in the column it belongs to,
other elements are all 0.
721
ut
We now conclude that when we make some special
column exchanges for HT , we obtain the row simplest
form of the transformed matrix. Notice that the optimal
solution a
must contain the same elements with the last
row
of the row simplest form. Because the column
subscripts of a
and the last row of its corresponding
simplest form are different, we can obtain the real a by
tracing historical column exchanges.
From the above analysis, we can see that when we make
all possible column exchanges of HT , the corresponding
row simplest form can be obtained. Because H is a m
nðm > n
Þ matrix, we should
make n! times column
exchanges to obtain all the row simplest forms. There will
be a solution in each row simplest form. Then, one of the
solutions which has the least number of nonzero elements
will be chosen as the optimal solution ultimately.
3.3
A Heuristic Approach
For a small-size network, we can use a straightforward bruteforce
search or the above-described linear-programming
approach to find the optimal set of meter measurements to
compromise. Notice that our experimental results in Section
5 show that the linear transformation-based approach
obtains the same results as brute-force search (when k ¼ 1).
For example, it requires 0.013 and 0.561 seconds for the
MATLAB program to search the whole space of IEEE 9- and
14-bus systems, respectively. However, when the size of the
network becomes larger, the overhead of both the brute-force
and linear transformation-based approach increase exponentially.
For example, for a 30-bus power network, the
brute-force method needs more than one day to completely
search the space and the linear transformation-based
approach needs to make 29! ¼ 8:84
exchanges to calculate the optimal solution. A detailed
comparison of the computation cost of different approaches

will be presented at the end of this section.
To deal with the large network, we now develop a
heuristic approach. In particular, we first investigate g
given a set of state variables. From (5), we can see that for a
given set of buses
, the largest factor to g is ð3 Pik
i¼i1 jQijÞ,
which is from the buses connected to
. Hence, for a given
k, when
represents a set of buses connected to each other
with the largest degree and connected to the least number
of buses beyond
, the value of g
will be smaller. This
insight indicates that the optimal set of sensor measurements
should consider buses that are geographically close
to each other.
Based on the above observation, we propose our heuristic-based
approach that searches the problem space in a
hierarchical way. Specifically, we divide the large network
into regions and then obtain g through multiple levels. In
this way, the complexity of the algorithm can be largely
reduced. Notice that to cover a more complete search space,
these regions should be overlapping. Our heuristic algorithm
consists of two levels. In the first level, the large
network is divided into N small overlapping areas. In each
area, the brute-force search method can be used to obtain a
subsolution gNi . In the second level, g is determined by
combining all subsolutions for the large network.

Computation Complexity Comparison
To demonstrate the efficiency of our heuristic-based
approach (denoted as BF+H, where BF presents brute force
for region and H presents the hierarchical regions), we
compare its computational complexity (BF+H) with that of
pure linear transformation algorithm(LT), brute-force
search method, and hierarchical linear transformation
algorithm (LT+H). All results are shown in Table 1. We
assume that vector c is n-dimensional. Because the pure
linear transformation algorithm needs to conduct n! times
matrix transformation to obtain an optimal solution, its
computational complexity is n!. The method in [8] essentially
belongs to the random search algorithm. Notice that
only if we traverse all possibilities, the optimal solution can
be derived. The complexity of the algorithm is oð2nÞ. Recall
that, they first randomly conducted 1,000 times experiments
by choosing kð1 k 10Þ state variables and generating
malicious data for each of them. Then, the solution of the
problem is selected based on 1,000 times experiments. In a
small-size network, the method may achieve a good result
in a short period of time. However, for a large-size network,
such as IEEE 300-bus system, when k ¼ 3 the algorithm
could only go through 0.66 percent of all the possibilities. It
is obvious that when the size of the network becomes larger,
the complexity of both the pure linear transformation
algorithm and the brute-force method will become too
large to obtain the solution efficiently. Differently, our
proposed heuristic-based approach divides the state variable
vector c into several regions, adopts the brute-force
search method to traverse all the possibilities and calculates
the suboptimal solution of each region independently. In
this way, we can achieve a local optimum solution quickly.
Suppose that vector c is n-dimensional, and partitioned into
N parts, then the computational complexity of our algorithm
is oð2Nn 1Þ. In the same way, if we use the linear
transformation algorithm in each region instead, the
complexity will be ðNn Þ!. In summary, we conclude our
heuristic-based algorithm derives solution with a low
computation complexity.

COUNTERMEASURES
In this section, we develop countermeasures against the false
data-injection attacks. We design the defensive countermeasures
from the following perspectives: 1) protectionbased
defense, and 2) anomaly detection-based defense.
4.1
Protection
Because a power grid usually covers a large geographical
area-for example, >1 million kilometer2, it is practical for
the system operators to choose some “important meters”
from all the meters to protect, for example, by a combination
of encryption, continuous monitoring, separation from
the Internet [17]. The meters in power system DC state
estimation belong to two kinds: bus real power injections
and line real power flows. As mentioned above, there is
1 meter on each bus measuring its real power injection and
2 meters on each transmission line measuring the line real
power flows.
We now illustrate our proposed protection strategy
using an example based on IEEE 30-bus system shown in
Fig. 3. From this figure, bus 9 is connected to buses 6,10, and
11. We know that if the adversary wants to change the state
variable of bus 9, he/she needs to compromise the meters of
power injections P9, P6, P10, and P11, and power flows P96,
P69, P9;10, P10;9, P9;11, and P11;9. On the other hand, if the
system operator protects the meter of bus power injection
P9, the adversary will have no chance to manipulate
the state variables of buses 9, 6, 10, and 11. If the meter
on the transmission line (e.g., P96) is protected, only the
state variables of buses 9 and 6 cannot be manipulated.
From the above example, we can see the meters
that measure bus injection powers play a more important
role in meter protection than the meters that measure the
transmission line power flows. We can explain this from the
essential of state estimation, the measurements of bus
power injections play a critical role in determining a specific
state variable, while the measurements of line power flows
are redundant to improve the accuracy of state estimation.
If the injection power flow of bus i is protected, the search
space for the adversary will be decreased from ðnkÞ to
ðn j@kij 1Þ. Hence, protecting meters that measure the injection
power flows of buses connected to the largest number
of buses will increase the difficulty of conducting false datainjection
attacks when it impractical to protect all buses in
large power grid systems.
4.2
Spatial-Based Detection
Recall that in stealthy attacks, the adversary may change
measurements from multiple sensors marginally, so that
individual compromised measurement will not be detected
by the statistical anomaly detection discussed above. To
detect such stealthy attacks, we introduce a novel spatialbased
detection scheme based on hypothesis testing.
Once the measurement vector has been collected in the
control center, a decision should be made on whether the
measurement vector is associated with an attack. Based on
the hypothesis test [18], we use the distribution of
measurements as the detection feature. To detect false
data-injection attacks, we consider two hypotheses: H0 and
H1. H0 is the null hypothesis, where the measurement is
valid; and H1 is the alternative hypothesis, where the
measurement is under attack. With the nonzero elements in
the attack vector a, the two hypothesis can be described by
H0 : kak0 ¼ 0;
H1 : kak0 > 0:
ð12Þ
As we can see in (3), the measurement residual in state
estimation can be divided into two parts: ðz HxbÞ and
ða HcÞ, which are derived from the measurement vector
and the attack vector. Recall that the false data-injection
attacks cannot be detected by LNR test because the false
measurement makes a Hc to be zero when the
adversary knows the system topology (i.e., H) and bad
detection algorithm.
We assume a Bayesian model, where the measurements
are random with a multivariate Gaussian distribution,
YANG ET AL.: ON FALSE DATA-INJECTION ATTACKS AGAINST POWER SYSTEM STATE ESTIMATION: MODELING AND...
723
which can be estimated based on historical data. Notice that
Gaussian distribution has been widely used to describe
quantitative phenomena in the natural and behavioral
sciences. The use of the Gaussian distribution can be
theoretically justified by assuming that many small independent
effects are additively contributing to each observation.
However, when false data-injection attacks exist, it
must change some specific measurements marginally and
the combination of those measurements will lead to the
state variables derived far from their true values. We would
like to point out that one compromised measurement's
deviation from its mean value (jzi Zij) may be too small
and recognized as the random noise. However, when we
accumulate the deviations of all the measurements in a
vector from their means, the accumulated deviation
ðPim¼1 ðzi Z2iÞ2Þ can be stood out. Our detection scheme is
based on ithis insight to recognize attacks.
We assume that the measurement vector z follows
multivariate Gaussian distributed and zi (i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; m)
is independent of each other, denoted as z NmðZ; Þ. Z is
the mean vector and is a diagonal covariance matrix. Let
JðzÞ ¼ ðz ZÞT 1ðz ZÞ, we have
Based on this, the hypothesis test is given by
JðzÞ
2ðmÞ:
H1
JðzÞ >< ;
H0
ð13Þ
ð14Þ
where ¼ 2 ðmÞ is a threshold determined by considering
the null hypothesis at a certain false positive rate .
To evaluate the effectiveness of the spatial-based detection
based on hypothesis test, we choose the detection rate
(same as the true positive) and false positive rate as the
evaluation metrics. In particular, we define detection rate
PD as the probability that the false data-injection attacks is
correctly recognized. False positive rate, PF is the probability
that a normal measurement vector is misclassified as
attacks. The more effective detection algorithms are the
ones that can achieve higher detection rates and lower false
positive rates. In our performance evaluation in Section 5,
we will use receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to
show the relationship between PD and PF .
4.3 Temporal-Based Detection
To detect attacks marginally manipulating data over time,
we adopt the temporal-based detection using online
nonparametric cusum change detection mechanism. In
particular, given the two hypotheses in (12), the cusum
algorithm assumes the observation yðiÞ starts under H0
(with a probability distribution p0) and at a time ks it
changes to hypothesis H1 (with a probability distribution
p1). The goal of such a detection scheme is to recognize this
change within the shortest time [19]. Given a false positive
rate, the temporal-based detection tends to minimize the
time N (N ks) of detection. The classic cusum algorithm is
based on computing the following statistics:
SðkÞ ¼ max 0; log p1ðyðkÞÞ þ Sðk
p0ðyðkÞÞ
1Þ ; Sð0Þ ¼ 0:
ð15Þ
Hence, the detection time can be derived by N ¼
infnfn : SðnÞ g, where is a threshold selected based
on the false positive rate.
Considering the case where the probability distributions
of measurements and the attack are not known, we
use nonparametric statistics. Let ziðkÞ be the measurement
of the ith meter at the time k. We define the observation
yiðiÞ as following, yiðkÞ ¼ jziðkÞ Qið Þj, where Qið Þ is
the -percentiles 2 ð0; 1Þ derived from the historical data.
The nonparametric cusum statistics for the ith measurement
becomes SiðkÞ ¼ maxf0; Siðk 1Þ þ jziðkÞ Qið Þjg,
Sið0Þ ¼ 0.
Then, a decision rule can be made by
H1
SiðkÞ >< i;
H0
ð16Þ
where i is a threshold selected based on the false positive
rate for the ith measurement. Notice the selection of
threshold is a tradeoff between the detection time and the
false positives.
To evaluate the effectiveness of the spatial-based detection-based
online nonparametric cusum change, we consider
two metrics: false positive rate and detection time.
False positive rate is defined as the ratio, at which the actual
value is H0 but it is determined to be H1. Detection time is
the average time that it takes to detect the change or attack.
As we can see, the most useful temporal detection scheme is
the one that has low values of both metrics. In Section 5, we
will evaluate the effectiveness of temporal-based detection
on these two metrics.

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
In this section, we conduct experiments to investigate the
effectiveness of the least-effort attack and corresponding
countermeasures.
Simulation setup. To validate the least-effort attacks and
countermeasures studied in Sections 3 and 4, we simulate
our approaches using MATLAB 7.9.0. All the parameters
used in the test cases, including the real value of state
variables, sensor measurements, and the measurement
matrix H, are based on the MATLAB package MATPOWER
[20]. We first evaluate the least-effort attacks investigated in
Section 3, we use the brute-force search and linear
transformation-based approach to inject attacks into small
networks (i.e., the IEEE 9-bus and 14-bus systems), and the
hierarchical search approach into large networks (i.e., IEEE
30-bus, 118-bus, and 300-bus systems), respectively. We
then evaluate countermeasures investigated in Section 4
based on the IEEE 14-bus network.
Least-effort false data-injection attacks. For small-size networks,
the optimal set of meters to compromise can be
obtained by using a straightforward brute-force or linear
transformation-based approach, while for large-size networks,
it is obtained by our proposed heuristic-based
approach. We first simulate the least-effort attacks
using brute-force approach on small networks, including
IEEE 9-bus and 14-bus systems. In our experiments,
we set the number of state variables to be manipulated as
724
IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS, VOL. 25, NO. 3, MARCH 2014
Fig. 1. Brute-force search for IEEE 9-bus.
k ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; 5 for the IEEE 9-bus system (n ¼ 8) and k ¼
1; 2; . . . ; 7 for the IEEE 14-bus system (n ¼ 13), respectively.
We set the false data ciði ¼ i1; i2; . . . ; ikÞ as 0.5 (10 percent of
the true state variable value in the IEEE 14-bus system). We
use (5) and the brute-force approach to compute the
n
number of nonzero elements of all the ðkÞ attack vector a,
and examine the combination of error vector c, which
requires the least effort. It takes only 0.22 and 0.55 seconds
for the brute-force approach to find the least number of
meters to compromise for the two systems, respectively.
We compare the brute-force approach with the random
search approach in [8]. To be specific, we randomly choose
k state variables and inject false data into them, by
conducting such experiments 103 times like [8]. To
thoroughly test the efficiency of the random search
approach, we conduct the same experiments for 106 times.
The results of the least number of meter measurements
to be compromised for each scenario are demonstrated in
Figs. 1 and 2.
For the IEEE 9-bus system, we can see that the bruteforce
approach and the random search approach achieve
almost the same results because of the small search space
for such a small-scale system. Nonetheless, for the larger
IEEE 14-bus system, the results of random search approach
with 103 rounds are larger than those of the brute-force
approach when k ¼ 6 and 7, while the results of random
search approach with 106 rounds achieve the similar results
as the brute-force one. This is because 103 times random
experiments cannot cover the whole space while
13
ð 6 Þ ¼ 1;716. Hence, we can conclude that for a small
network, the random search approach is almost as efficient
as the brute-force search method.
We simulate the least-effort attacks based on the linear
transformation-based approach on the IEEE 9-bus system.
We make 8! ¼ 40;320 times column exchanges for HT , and
obtain the row simplest form for each changed matrix. We
calculate the number of nonzero elements in the last row of
every row simplest form. The optimal solution a is the one
which has the minimum number of nonzero elements. We
show the simplest form that contains the optimal solution in
Fig. 4. We can see the last row of this row simplest form
contains four nonzero elements, which are in the columns of
13, 22, 26, and 27. By tracing the way we make column
exchange, we find this row simplest form belongs to a
matrix which is obtained by exchanging the third column
with the 27th column, and the sixth column with the 26th
Fig. 2. Brute-force search for IEEE 14-bus.
column of HT . So the nonzero elements in the real a is a3,
a6, a13, and a22. That is to say, the least-effort attack needs to
compromise four measurements (i.e., z3, z6, z13, and z22). As
we can see, the linear transformation-based approach
obtains the optimal solution, which is the same as the
brute-force search (when k ¼ 1).
We also simulate the false data-injection attacks against
large networks, including the IEEE 30-bus, 118-bus, and
300-bus systems, using the heuristic-based approach. In our
experiments, we set the number of targeted state variables
k ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; 15. For example, we divided the IEEE 30-bus
systems into m ¼ 3 areas and each area contains niði ¼
1; 2; 3Þ buses, as shown in Fig. 3. In each area, we inject the
false data into all the ðnkiÞ possible state vectors, and used (5)
to examine the attack vector a, which contains the
minimum number of nonzero elements. We compare the
suboptimal sets of each area and obtain the optimal set of
meters to compromise. As we can see in Fig. 5, to
manipulate four state variables, we need to compromise
at least 10-meter measurements.
We also compare the random search approach with the
hierarchical-based search approach. Fig. 5 shows that when
k is larger than 8, the hierarchical-based approach always
works better than the other two approaches. From the
perspective of probability theory, when the network
becomes large, the search space and search time become
larger, leading to the random search approach inefficient.
We conducted the same experiments on networks with
the IEEE 118-bus and 300-bus. In particular, we divide the
IEEE 118-bus system into N ¼ 12, and the IEEE 300-bus
system into N ¼ 30 areas, respectively. Figs. 6 and 7 show
the results of the two tested networks. As we can see, the

hierarchical-based approach can always find more accurate
results than the random search approach quickly, especially
when the size of the system is large. Notice that in Figs. 5, 6,
and 7, there are bumpy curves for two reasons. First, the
results of random search rely heavily on the number of
times the search is conducted. When the number of searches
is not sufficiently large, the random search process only
covers part of the search space. This makes the results look
random and bumpy. Second, in the heuristic approach, we
first divide the network into a number of overlapping areas,
use the brute-force search or linear programming to identify
the optimal set of meters for individual small areas, and
then derive the set of meters for the whole network.
Although the heuristic-based approach could significantly
reduce the complexity of the algorithm and yield much
better results than the random search approach, it could not

cover the whole search space and may, therefore, miss
certain optimal solutions, leading to the curves of results
occasionally having bumpy points.
We now show the overhead of the computation
complexity of our hierarchical-based approach. Table 2
shows the complexity of brute-force search (BF), the
complexity of heuristic-based search (BF+H), the random
search time (RS) given the iteration of 106, and the time for
BF+H for the IEEE 30-bus, 118-bus, and 300-bus, respectively.
As we can see, our hierarchical-based approach can
not only find more accurate attacking vector but also
compute in shorter time than the random search approach
with low computation complexity.
Protecting critical meters. Fig. 8 shows the topology of
IEEE 14-bus system. In this figure, we choose to protect bus
4 because it connects to the largest number of buses. As we
can see, bus 4 is connected to five other buses, 2, 3, 5, 7, and
9. We know that if the meter measuring P4 is unknown to
the adversary or cannot be compromised, he cannot change
4; 2; 3; 5; 7, and 9. This is because if he does inject false
data into one of the above state variables, he must
compromise P4 at the same time. Obviously, this leads to

a smaller search space (e.g., higher cost) to conduct
the least-effort attack than the scenario when the complete
topology information is known.
Fig. 9 shows the least number of meters to compromise
when P4 is protected and cannot be compromised. We
randomly choose one sensor measurement to be protected
and compute the least number to compromise. We repeated
the experiments 100 times and obtained the mean value to
compare with the scenario, where P4 is protected. As we
can see, if the adversary wants to manipulate kðk > 2Þ state
variables, he will have to compromise more meters when
the important measurements are protected than the scenarios,
where the meters are randomly protected.
If we make a set of active power flows of buses whose
adjacent buses can cover all the buses in the power system
unknown to the adversary, the search space of meters to
compromise becomes 0, so it is impossible for the adversary
to deploy false data-injection attacks.
Results of spatial-based detection. Notice that the SCADA
system collects the real-time information of power field and
reports the data to the control center every 2 to 4 seconds
[21]. In our evaluation, we run simulations for 1 hour
without attacks to collect enough samples and derive the
mean values and covariance of all measurements in the
IEEE 14-bus system. We then set the detection threshold
of chi-square distribution by choosing the false positive rate
¼ 0:1. We exhaustively search all the bad measurement
vectors based on the attack model a ¼ Hc. We use the
detection rule defined in (14) to calculate the number of
times that the JðzÞ > , and derive the detection rate by
PD ¼ ##aJllðztrÞ>ails . We collect 1,000 normal measurement
vectors, which only contain random noise, use the detection
rule defined in (14) to compute the total number of times
PwFhe¼n#tJ1h;ð0ze0Þ0>J.ðzBÞa>sed on the ðPF ; PDÞ given a threshold, we
and derive the false positive rate by

draw the ROC, which represents the detection rate versus
false positive rate.
Fig. 10 shows the ROC curves for the IEEE 14-bus system
in terms of different magnitudes, which determine the
strength of data to be manipulated. Similar to the signal-tonoise
ratio (SNR), we define signal-to-attack ratio (SAR) to
quantify the attack's “power” or strength, that is,
SAR ¼ 10 log10 xcii . We find that when we increase the
threshold, both the detection rate and the false positive
rate increase. Hence, the selection of the threshold is a
tradeoff between the detection rate and false positive rate.
We can see that the efficiency of the detection algorithm is
improved compared with the case when SAR ¼ 17 dB and
the detection rate approaches 88 percent. While SAR ¼
11 dB, the detection algorithm can recognize 98.8-98.9 percent
attacks. As we can see, the detection rate becomes higher
when the attack's power/strength rises. This is because
the deviation of the observed measurements from their
means is more significant when the attack becomes stronger.
Results of temporal-based detection. We implemented the
proposed temporal-based detection algorithm on the IEEE
14-bus system. In the experiments, we run simulations for
1 hour without attacks and collected the meters of z3, z4, z20,
which measure the power injections of P3, P4, and power
flow of P34, respectively. We set ¼ 0:9 and then obtain the
percentiles of P3, P4, and P34 as Q3ð Þ ¼ 94:19, Q4ð Þ ¼
47:81, Q20ð Þ ¼ 24:24.
We run simulations for 1,000 times without attacks and
compute the total number of false positives for different
values of . The false positive rate, PF can be defined as
PF ¼ #fal1s;e00a0larms . Fig. 11 shows the results for z3, z4, z20. We
can see for z20, the false positive rate will become very low
when we set > 50.

With the attack model a ¼ Hc, Fig. 12 shows the average
detection time by conducting 1,000 times experiments based
on our proposed nonparametric cusum algorithm in terms of
the thresholds: z3, z4, and z20, respectively. As we can see,
the detection time increases linearly as the threshold
increases. This is because is selected based on the false
positive rate, which is a tradeoff between the detection time
and the false positives. We can also observe that the more
measurement's value is changed by the attack, the earlier
the false data-injection attacks will be detected by our
proposed detection algorithm. From Fig. 11, we can see
selecting as high as possible for each sensor can reduce the
false positives. Nevertheless, increasing will require more
time to detect attacks.

RELATED WORK
In this section, we briefly review the related work and
illustrate the main novelties of our proposed research. After
[8], a number of efforts have been paid to false datainjection
attacks against power system state estimation [13],
[17], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31],
[32]. For example, based on the work of [8], Liu et al. further
studied the false data-injection attacks and proposed more
generalized attack models in [13]. To defend against the
false data-injection attacks, Bobba et al. [25] developed
schemes to protect a selected set of meter measurements.
Kosut et al. [21] developed a scheme to detect the attack.
Pasqualetti et al. [28] proposed a distributed state estimation
method with a group of connected control centers and
developed a distributed algorithm to detect false data
injection attacks.
The study of false data-injection attacks has been
extended [17], [19], [30], [31], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37]. For
example, Mo and Sinopoli [30] studied false data injection
attacks and defensive method in the models of using
Kalman Filter and LQG controller. Lin et al. [35] investigated
the vulnerability of distributed energy distribution
and investigate novel false data injection attacks against the
energy distribution. Mohsenian-Rad and Leon-Garcia [36]
studied attacks against the consumption sector, by investigating
load altering attacks and proposed a cost-efficient
load protection strategy. Kim and Poor [17] developed a
unified framework for constructing attack vectors, considering
the constraints on measurements and limited
sources associated with the adversary. Based on this
formulation, they proposed a defensive mechanism of
choosing a subset of measurements immune to the attacks
based on a greedy algorithm. Their work is similar to our
study of giving the attack partial knowledge of H matrix.
Nevertheless, our method is more general based on the
graph theory. Hossain et al. [37] studied the state-of-the-art
theory, key strategies, protocols, applications, deployment
aspects, and experimental studies of communication and
networking technologies for the smart grid.
Different from the existing research efforts, to the best of
our knowledge, our research is among the first of efforts
toward finding the minimal number of meter measurements
to compromise in a systematic way, developing
efficient algorithms to obtain the vector for attacks, and
developing novel protection and detection mechanisms to
effectively reduce the risk by false data injection attacks and
detect attacks accurately and quickly.

CONCLUSION
In this paper, we studied the false data-injection attacks and
corresponding countermeasures. In particular, we first
presented the least-effort attack model, which enables an
adversary to find the optimal set of meter measurements

given the number of state variables to manipulate in a
power grid system. We formalized the problem and
developed efficient algorithms to find the set of meters.
We implemented and tested our attacking approach on
various IEEE standard bus systems, and demonstrated their
superiority over the random search approach. To defend
against false data-injection attacks, we investigated the
protection-based defense and detection-based defense. For
the protection-based defense, we identified and protected
critical sensor and make the system more resilient to
attacks. For the detection-based defense, we developed
spatial-based and temporal-based detection schemes. Our
experimental data show that our spatial-based detection can
detect at least 95 percent of attacks when the adversary
changes up to 6 percent of the magnitude values of state
variables and the temporal-based algorithm can identify
compromised meters quickly given the historical data from
those meters.
