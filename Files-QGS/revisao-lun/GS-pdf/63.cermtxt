A Coordinated Multi-Switch Attack for Cascading
Failures in Smart Grid
Shan Liu, Bo Chen, Takis Zourntos, Deepa Kundur, and Karen Butler-Purry
Abstract-This paper explores distributed smart grid attack
strategies to destabilize power system components using variable
structure system theory. Here, an opponent is able to remotely
control multiple circuit breakers within a power system, say
through data corruption or communication network attack, to
destabilize target synchronous generators through application
of state-dependent breaker switching. In contrast to attack via a
single breaker, the multi-switch case provides additional degrees
of freedom that can lead to stealthier and wide-scale cascading
failures. We provide a dynamical systems context for formulating
distributed multi-switch strategies and execute such attacks on
the New England 10-generator 39-bus test system.

I. INTRODUCTION

T IS WELL known that the smart grid promises increased
advanced information (cyber) and energy (physical) infrastructure.
This greater dependence on information systems however
raises concerns as to how its integration will affect the cyber and
physical security of future power systems.
Historically, such cyber-enablement of classical application
fields including commerce, entertainment, and social interactions
has led to improved functionality and efficiency at the cost
of security. Thus, we assert the importance of addressing cyber
and physical security issues of emerging cyber-enabled power
systems. A first step in such a study will require the exploration
of novel vulnerabilities stemming from cyber-physical integration,
which we aim to address in this paper, to better develop
strategies for their mitigation.
There has been a movement toward addressing cyber-physical
aspects of system security. For instance, information confidentiality
has been addressed by studying cyber-to-physical
leakage via clues about cyber protocol activity in power system
voltage and current measurements [1], [2]. Novel risk analysis
frameworks that account for the physical impacts of cyber attacks
have been presented [3], [4]. To more comprehensively

account for the interaction between the power system and information
network, empirical approaches have been developed
that harness realistic communications and power systems simulators
[5].
We argue that to identify insidious weaknesses stemming
from cyber-physical interaction and evaluate mitigation approaches,
it is crucial that the physical notion of time be
incorporated into the modeling framework. Furthermore, we
believe that for the results to have useful meaning to electric
power utilities and for risk analysis, the model should loosely
represent select aspects of the system physics with appropriate
granularity. For this reason, our work represents a departure
from prior art by formulating the smart grid security problem
within a hybrid dynamical system context that is mathematically
representable and relates attack impacts to disturbances
on quantifiable power system performance metrics.
Our past work has focused on the application of variable
structure system theory to address a class of reconfiguration attacks
in power transmission systems called coordinated variable
structure switching attacks [6]-[11]. We have been able to identify
a novel class of vulnerabilities unique to smart power systems
that leverages the potential of an opponent to obtain estimates
of localized state information and remotely control an associated
circuit breaker. Here, an opponent can employ the local
state information to design a switching sequence for the breaker
that can cause transient instability of a target synchronous generator
leading to power disruption. One key observation from
these studies is the ease with which it is possible to destabilize
the power system dynamics (through the exploitation of
vulnerabilities in cyber infrastructure) by using short-duration
cyber-controlled switching of a single breaker.
In this paper, we aim to provide a more comprehensive assessment
of the security posture of a smart grid system by focusing
on a non-trivial extension to the single-switch coordinated
switching attack that makes use of multiple breaker corruptions
and collusion to create cascading failures within multiple
targets of the system. This shifts the vulnerability analysis
problem from one that can be visualized in a two-dimensional
plane to one in higher-order dimensions. Moreover, construction
of an attack has significantly greater degrees of freedom that
we explore by considering simultaneous, concurrent and progressive
approaches to switching. We therefore test our attack
framework for the first time on the 10-machine, 39-bus New
England power system in DSATools™ providing an opportunity
to study the effectiveness of the coordinated switching attack on
generators with local controllers.
In the next section, we present our multi-switch hybrid
dynamical systems modeling framework. Section III provides
mathematical examples to give insight on the different ways in

which multiple switching can be harnessed for system disruption.
In Section IV we demonstrate how the multi-switch attack
principles can be applied to the popular 39-bus New England
test power system for targeted and more global power system
disruptions through transient destabilization of select system
generators. Final remarks and avenues for future research are
presented in Section V.
II. DISTRIBUTED MULTI-SWITCH FRAMEWORK
A. Variable Structure Systems
Variable structure systems represent an elegant hybrid dynamical
systems framework in which to study the behavior
of systems with switched dynamics. Here, the dynamics of a
system with state change (or switch) to one of a set
of predefined subsystems depending on the value of a switching
signal that is time and/or state-dependent. In the case
of scalar and two subsystems a general structure for a
variable structure system can be given by:
(1)
For certain structures and parameters of system dynamics and
selections of , it can be shown that the overall switched
system exhibits sliding mode behavior. In the sliding mode,
while switching persists, the state of the overall switched system
is attracted to and stays on the manifold termed
a sliding surface of the variable structure system. The sliding
mode property of variable structure systems has been useful
classically for system stabilization to steer the system state from
possible instability to a desirable equilibrium position. An excellent
background on sliding mode control can be found in [12],
[13] and references therein; moreover, [14] provides an excellent
tutorial on the subject.
Recently, the authors have modeled smart grid transmission
systems under reconfiguration (e.g., remotely controlled
“smart” circuit breaker switching) as variable structure systems.
We have demonstrated how, in contrast, transient instability
of a target synchronous generator can be induced by an opponent
who has corrupted a circuit breaker and switches it open
or closed depending on the sign of an appropriately defined
[6], [7]. The system state represents the phase and
frequency of the target generator and the switching has the
effect of disrupting both the generator frequency and phase
thus desynchronizing it.
Much of the analysis of variable structure systems within
the existing literature assumes a single scalar switching signal
. In this vein, the authors' past work has considered
the application of sliding mode theory when a single circuit
breaker is corrupted and employed for transient instability of a
sole target synchronous generator. Such a formulation is valuable
for identifying local cyber-physical vulnerabilities within
smart grid systems, but by nature cannot model potential distributed
attacks that can lead to cascading failures.
B. Distributed Switching for Attack
We consider a power system consisting of circuit
breakers or switches. We assume that an opponent (or possibly a
Fig. 1. New England 10-machine, 39-bus power system.
colluding collective of opponents) has control over
breakers through, say, corruption of breaker control signals via
attacks on the associated communication network, as discussed
in [6], [7]. The objective of the opponent is to disrupt the operation
of the power system through transient destabilization of
one or more target synchronous generators denoted
assuming that the opponent has some knowledge of
the target generator states. Such destabilization will cause generator
protection relays to trip taking the corresponding generators
off-line. Although loss of a single generator may not be of
significant concern, in our distributed multi-switch framework
we investigate the effects of possible cascading outages.
We consider the situation in which the strategy of the opponent
is to model the overall system as a variable structure system
and apply state-dependent switching to the corrupted switches
such that sliding mode behavior is manifested. If the particular
sliding mode is unstable, then transient instability of target synchronous
generators will be induced. Consider for example the
39-bus New England test system of Fig. 1. Suppose that an opponent
has control over the breakers connecting Lines 26-28
and 28-29 and has established Generators 8 and 9 as targets.
The task of the opponent would be to construct a switching sequence
based on variable structure system theory using knowledge
of the phase and frequencies of Generators 8 and 9 for each
of the switches at Line 26-28 and Line 28-29. If successful, the
switching would induce sliding mode behavior and thus transient
destabilization of its targets. Questions naturally arise regarding
how multi-switching should be strategized.
Thus, part of our focus in this paper is to explore different
ways to incorporate multiple corrupted switches to target multiple
synchronous generators. In the next section, we provide
a general variable structure system framework. The model is
somewhat general so that the attack may be readily applicable
to other forms of instability (e.g., frequency and voltage) and
for other types of target components such as transformers or
transmission lines beyond the scope of this paper. Moreover,
it enables us to consider different multi-switch attack strategies
within the same system to assess the various compromises. In
LIU et al.: A COORDINATED MULTI-SWITCH ATTACK FOR CASCADING FAILURES IN SMART GRID
Section IV we specifically focus on transient destabilization and
our models are more specific.
C. Multiple Switching Signals
The multi-switch investigation necessitates that the switching
signal of Section II-A be a switching vector signal
where is the number of corrupted switches; the
sign of each element of provides information to an opponent
on whether to open or close a specific breaker for attack.
There is limited variable structure system theory literature dedicated
to this extended multi-switch situation. We do not provide
theoretical foundations for this underdeveloped class of problems.
In contrast, we aim to explore through examples how the
multiple switch problem can be constructed and exploited for
system destabilization. For the remainder of the paper we consider
only time-invariant state-dependent vector switching signals
and denote it for simplicity as either or .
Consider a th order linear time invariant variable structure
system model with control inputs:
where is the time-dependent state vector,
is the input vector, is the system transformation
matrix and is the input matrix. The time-invariant
state-dependent switching signal is defined as
where is called the switching surface and
is the corresponding coefficient matrix; we denote the th element
of as such that . For
tractability, most switching signals are assumed to be linear
combinations of the system states. In our interpretation of the
problem a single circuit breaker, say called Switch , is controlled
via the sign of the th element of . Therefore, our framework
implicitly assumes that controllable breakers exist in
the system.
The role of in our formulation is two-fold. First, it represents
an appropriate step change in dynamics due to a sign
change in the elements of ; thus we expect components
in to have the desired effect of switching the nature
of the dynamics as the signs of the switching signal elements
change. Second, it modifies the system dynamics in our instructive
example of Section III using a second order linear feedback
component to guarantee an appropriate sliding mode exists
for a given and multi-switch strategy. The reader should
note that in an actual power system attack scenario addressed in
Section IV, the action of an opponent would result only in the
first -dependent component.
Consider switching surfaces for
whereby their intersection is compactly denoted meaning
. To determine the existence
of the sliding surface for a general class of variable
structure systems it is sufficient to establish that the following
condition holds (for ) [14]:
(2)
(3)
(4)
1185
(5)
Typically, the guarantee that (4) holds occurs for a local region
of state space. Thus a state trajectory would have to enter this
local region to guarantee attraction to the sliding surface ;
once the state is within the region of attraction persistent sliding
mode switching will guarantee that the state is attracted to
and remains on that surface.
Condition (4) does not guarantee that the individual sliding
surfaces exist for . If they exist for a
subset then the following additional
conditions must hold, again, for a possibly local region about
the sliding surface:
In the multi-switch cases that follow, we consider the scenario
in which each of the switches open and close according to
the sign of a particular element of . For
example, the th switch would open for and close when
. The terminal sliding surface for attack is the intersection
of all of the individual switching surfaces . Moreover we
assume that individual sliding surfaces exist for for
. The existence of individual sliding surfaces provided by (5)
enables the possibility of employing a variety of multi-switch
strategies that we investigate for power system attack in this
paper.
Throughout the paper the authors adopt a compact notation
common to systems theory to describe the dynamical representations
and variables. However such a convention, albeit simpler,
may not readily provide information on temporal or state
dependencies that could better elucidate the concepts and relationships
in a power systems context. Therefore, we provide a
summary in Table I of the key variables of this paper and their
associated dependencies.
D. Attack Assumptions and Overview
A vulnerability in a system exists when there is a flaw in the
system, access to the flaw and a capability by an opponent to exploit
the flaw. We consider the vulnerability we address in this
paper to be cyber-physical in nature because a physical weakness
is exploited through access provided by cyber (communications)
means.
In order to study a worst-case scenario for disruption we assume
that attacker communication is ideal and that corrupted
breakers are temporally synchronized in their switching. Moreover,
we assume that physical catastrophe instigated by the proposed
attack does not affect the performance of the associated
communication system.
1) Attacker Knoweldge: To leverage variable structure
system theory to construct a smart grid attack, an opponent
would need:
1) to identify a set of (physical) target synchronous generators
to attack denoted ;
2) electromechanical switching control over corrupted
circuit breakers in the targets' proximity;
3) knowledge of the targets' states ; and
4) a local model of the smart grid system encompassing the
targets.

Physical means to obtain such measurement data and control
switching actions requires that the opponent employ geographically
proximal and perhaps even distributed and unstealthy techniques,
which is impractical for resource constrained opponents.
However, with the increased dependence on information technology
and its proposed large-scale connectivity, it is feasible
that such approaches will be implemented remotely through an
effective sequence of cyber intrusions.
In order to implement the attack remotely an opponent must
exploit one or more cyber vulnerabilities within the associated
communications and computing devices. Numerous practical
examples of current and expected cyber weaknesses in power
deliver networks have been documented [15] that range from
exploiting the lack of cyber security mechanisms in legacy
technology to exploiting holes in well known operating systems
used by measurement and control devices. The types of
cyber intrusions necessary to be able to execute a coordinated
variable-structure switching attack will be specific to the actual
system hardware and software and is beyond the scope of
this work. However, common approaches may involve data
interception, modification and fabrication. Direct means of
cyber attack could involve the eavesdropping of local state
information from phasor measurement units along communication
links and the fabrication of circuit breaker control signals
to implement the switching attack. Indirect means could entail
the interception of related measurement information to estimate
the current state and subsequent false data injection attacks on
state estimators [16] to induce incorrect decision-making to
force switching.
False data injection attacks are one form of cyber attack that
can be exploited for coordinated switching attacks; they have recently
been investigated by Liu et al. [16] in the context of state
estimation. We highlight that indeed such attacks may be exploited
to facilitate our proposed attack. Our work, in contrast,
is focused on how cyber attacks such as these on the information
system can be harnessed to exploit a physical weakness such as
sliding mode instability to establish a new form of cyber-physical
vulnerability that has the potential to bring about cascading
failures.
2) Attack Construction and Execution: Based on this
information an opponent would model the local grid as a
variable structure system where is given by the states of
and switching occurs at the corrupted
breaker(s). An opponent would then construct an attack by
determining an appropriate sliding mode surface for
system destabilization. The attack would be executed using
knowledge of such that the opponent would close (open)
Breaker for . The stages of attack
construction (conducted off-line a priori) and execution can be
represented as follows:
1) Select the target generators for
which state information is available or can be estimated.
2) Select the corrupted or corruptible breakers.
3) Mathematically represent the associated target smart grid
system as a variable structure system keeping the switching
rule general, where the th breaker status is
controlled by the value of the th element of for
.
4) Test the existence of sliding mode surfaces according to
(4) and (5). If a range of exists for attack then select a
value analytically or empirically; details beyond the scope
of this paper are provided in [8].
5) Based on the existence of the overall and individual
switching surfaces, design a strategy for multiple switching
as we will discuss in Section III.
LIU et al.: A COORDINATED MULTI-SWITCH ATTACK FOR CASCADING FAILURES IN SMART GRID
1187
6) Execute the attack by employing switching of the corrupted
breakers such that Breaker is closed (open) for
.
The reader should note that for a given smart grid system,
set of target generators and set of
corrupted breakers, a range of may be valid for attack although
it is possible that no value for exists to instigate sliding
mode behavior. In the former situation, typically the attack can
achieve its goal within the order of seconds for any valid value
of , but depending on the specific value of , the particular
system state behavior toward instability would be different. In
the latter case, no coordinated variable structure switching attack
is possible. In such a situation, the opponent could attempt
to change the set of target generators or expand the set of corrupt
breakers. The reader should note that existence of the sliding
mode thus provides a convenient way to assess the existence of
vulnerabilities and prioritize system components for hardening
as discussed by the authors in [8].
III. MULTIPLE SWITCHING AND THE SLIDING MODE
We consider three approaches to illustrate how multiple
corrupted switches can be exploited by an opponent for
system disruption. For simplicity we focus on a two-swxitch
situation in which ; the general -switch
case would represent a natural extension to this multi-switch
foundation. We first consider a case, called synchronized
switching, whereby the switches have the same switching
surfaces thus are synchronized with
switching occurring simultaneously. Next, we focus on the
case of concurrent switching, in which the switches have distinct
switching surfaces and
with switching occurring simultaneously. Last, we focus on
progressive switching where switches with distinct switching
surfaces begin in tandem.
To demonstrate the application of different strategies for
multi-switch variable structure system attacks, we make use of
the following fundamental third-order canonical form realization
of the linear time-invariant system of (2):
(6)
As discussed in Section II-C, we assign the input
to be not only -dependent to represent the effects of switching,
but also -dependent to adjust the system dynamics such that
appropriate sliding modes exist to illustrate various switching
strategies within the same context.
The two switching surfaces are represented as:
Fig. 2. State trajectory for synchronized switching.
where is the coefficient vector of . In
Section IV, the opponent-corrupted switches are operated such
that when switching is applied, Switch opens if and
closes if for .
A. Synchronized Switching
We first consider the synchronized switching case where
because it provides a natural bridge between
our former single switch work [6], [7] and the multi-switch
extension in this paper. For the synchronized case, by definition
which implies that the sliding surface
can also be represented as and that
. We assume that the sliding surface
exists. The strategy here is to simultaneously and
persistently apply synchronized switching (i.e., having both
switches open and close at the same time) to Switches 1 and 2.
To be effective switching must occur when is in the region
of attraction of the sliding surface and consequently
the state will be driven to as illustrated in Fig. 2. In
this case the existence of (equivalent to ) also
implies the existence of the individual sliding surfaces.
To develop an illustrative example of the effects of simultaneous
switching, we consider our canonical system of (6) and
determine a to guarantee .
Consider:
where . There are a variety of strategies to
assign to guarantee sliding mode existence. In this paper
we assign such that , a common
approach within the sliding mode community. We therefore determine
such that

switching:

Figs. 3(a) and (b), respectively, demonstrating the stable nature
of the overall system. To apply a switching attack, is selected
such that:
(11)
The corresponding simulation results are shown in Fig. 4. As
can be observed, the system achieves instability demonstrating
the how the simultaneous switching case can disrupt system
operation.
B. Concurrent Switching
We next consider the situation in which the sliding surface
exists and the strategy is to simultaneously and persistently
apply sliding mode switching to Switches 1 and 2. To be
effective, switching must begin when is in the region of attraction
of the sliding surface and consequently the state

will be driven to as illustrated in Fig. 5. In this concurrent
switching case, individual sliding modes do not have to exist.
To develop an illustrative example of the effects of such concurrent
switching, we once again consider our canonical system
of (6) and determine a to guarantee . Such a system
will have resulting dynamics that we will use to demonstrate the
effects of system disruption due to multi-switch attacks. Consider:
There are a variety of strategies to assign to guarantee
sliding mode existence. We once again assign such that
as common and therefore determine such
that to give
and an overall
description of the system dynamics with concurrent switching:
1) Unstable Sliding Modes: Sliding mode control has been
conventionally employed for stabilization. Thus, the resulting
dynamics after the state reaches the sliding surface and remains
there are stable. In contrast, for power system disruption, opponents
aim to identify unstable sliding modes through appropriate
selection of .
We employ the method of equivalent control to determine an
effective set of system dynamics on the sliding surface.
Therefore we set:
Solving for gives us the equivalent control
. Thus, the effective system dynamics on
the sliding surface becomes:

(17)
LIU et al.: A COORDINATED MULTI-SWITCH ATTACK FOR CASCADING FAILURES IN SMART GRID
1189
It is easy to see from the structure of matrix
that the eigenvalues are 0, 0 and .
Thus to guarantee instability of this linear system it is necessary
that the non-zero eigenvalue be positive. Thus, should be selected
such that
It is clear that such a exists with appropriately selected parameters.
Thus a multi-switch attack is feasible in this case.
2) Numerical Illustration: Consider the canonical system for
and . The original system state
trajectories and state values as a function of time are shown in
Figs. 3(a) and (b), respectively, demonstrating the stable nature
of the overall system. To apply a switching attack, is selected
to fulfill Condition (18) by assigning:
(18)
(19)
which provides eigenvalues for at 0, 0 and
as desired. (13) describes the system's evolution to
. Figs. 6(a) and (b) demonstrate the system state behavior
and Figs. 6(c) and (d) give the switch status. It is clear that the
switching induces system instability within a short period of
time even when the original system is stable.
C. Progressive Switching
Consider the case in which the sliding surface and
an individual sliding surface , say, both exist. For such
a situation, it is possible for an opponent to apply concurrent
switching as discussed in the previous section. There however
may be disadvantages to this for a successful attack. First, the
region of convergence for the sliding surface may be
difficult to reach for certain system conditions in which say the
equilibrium position is distant from the region of convergence.
Furthermore, the opponent may prefer to be stealthy for a period
of time slowly moving the trajectory to a seemingly stable but
vulnerable position prior to an appropriately timed disruption.
The additional timing control that this provides to an opponent
may be beneficial when intending to apply synchronized cyberphysical
attacks on the overall system.
We demonstrate in this section how an opponent can apply
progressive switching and appropriately leverage the existence
of an individual sliding surface to improve the stealthiness of an
attack. If we consider the two-switch case as illustrated in Fig. 7,
the opponent's aim is to first apply Switch 1 to attract a state

(b) System states. (c) Switch 1 status. (d) Switch 2 status.
that is within the region of attraction of the sliding
surface and then, while is moving on this individual sliding
surface, add Switch 2 as well to attract the overall system to the
sliding surface. If the individual sliding mode is
stable and the sliding mode is unstable an initially stealthy
but subsequently high impact attack is realized. We consider the
progressive switching attack to have the following three stages.
Stage 1: The system state is driven to the sliding
surface. We make use of our canonical form system of (6) and
illustrate this behavior by assigning an input as follows:
that guarantees the existence of the
face:
to obtain the overall Stage 1 dynamics, shown in
(21) at the bottom of the page.
Stage 2: The system state enters and remains on the
sliding surface. Here, the method of equivalent control can be
employed to describe the effective dynamics in the presence of
Switch 1 switching. We set to

overall Stage 2 dynamics:
. Substituting this into (6) gives
(22)
(23)
Analogous to Section III-B we can select to guarantee, in
contrast, the stability of the sliding surface.
Stage 3: The system state is driven to the sliding
surface at the intersection of and . To illustrate
this behavior, we once again set to give the Stage 3
dynamics of (13).
1) Numerical Illustration: Once again, we consider the
stable canonical system for and .
Using parallel reasoning to the concurrent switching example,
the two switching surfaces are selected as:
The corresponding simulation results of system trajectories,
system states, switches are shown in Fig. 8. As shown, during
Stages 1 and 2, the system trajectory is attracted to the
sliding surface and remains stable as Switch 1 is applied. However,
when Switch 2 is applied the joint switching has the effect
of destabilization the overall system when it is attracted to the
sliding surface.
IV. SIMULATIONS
In this section, we apply the multi-switch principles of the
previous section to the New England 10-machine, 39-bus
system of Fig. 1 employing DSATools™. The first step requires
identification of attack parameters from our variable structure
system model of the corresponding smart grid. Specifically,
we make use of the swing equation model in which generators
are not equipped with local controllers. The second
step implements the designed attack in a simulation model
that includes these controllers. The reader should note that
although our swing equation model does not include generator
control, our simulation model in DSATools™ includes
excitation and governor control for more realistic assessment.
The automatic voltage regulator (AVR) data is derived from
Fig. 8. System trajectories and states for progressive switching. (a) System trajectories.

(in PSS/E format), where the static and dynamic
data have been obtained from the example files of PST toolbox
(http://www.ecse.rpi.edu/pst/PST.html). The
turbine governor data is from the PSS/E program application
guide. Thus, our approach allows construction of an attack
using idealized analytical models that can effectively execute
under more realistic conditions.
Under non-attack conditions, the systems with AVR and turbine
governors are robust and stable to disturbance. However, as
we demonstrate in this section after our coordinated switching
attack is applied, the system can become unstable within the
order of seconds.
A. Attack Construction
An opponent's objective is to first construct an attack by selecting
a multi-switch strategy and determining the parameters
of to disrupt power delivery using a model of the power
system, and then execute the attack using local state information
of target generators. Moreover, it can be shown that this
attack is robust to model error and noisy states [10].
The overall system can be modeled via the swing equations
with the following dynamics:

th generators. Typical parameter values for the New England
system are assumed. The th (corrupted) breaker in the system
is assumed to target Generator and incorporate the following
switching signal with coefficients and :
(25)
The overall system is assumed to be initially at a stable equilibrium
point. The task of an opponent in control of the th corrupted
breaker would be to select the parameters and
judiciously to induce instability in Generator ; this can be conducted
empirically or analytically [8] using the model of (24).
Execution of the attack on Generator requires knowledge of
and .
We consider the concurrent and progressive approaches to
multi-switch attack and then consider how the multi-switch
framework can be leveraged by an opponent to initiate cascading
failures within the system. We do not provide results for
the synchronized switching case, which is somewhat analogous
to a single switch case since one common switching surface
is used for all switches. Instead for comparative purposes, we
provide results for the single switch case and compare it to our
multi-switch case to see the attack performance gains possible.
B. Single Switch Attack
We first assume an opponent corrupts the breaker corresponding
to Line 26-28 of Fig. 1 and targets Generator 9 to
induce instability employing the sliding surface .
Fig. 9 illustrates the corresponding effects on the system when
switching is applied starting at 10 s for only a 2-3 second duration.
Fig. 9(a) shows the state trajectory leading to instability
while Figs. 9(b), (c), and (d) demonstrate the time scale upon
which disruption occurs. The switch status used is presented in
Fig. 9(e).
Next we consider the situation in which the breaker of Line
28-29 is corrupted and targets Generator 9 once again to induce
instability using . Fig. 10 presents the results of
the attack starting at 10 s demonstrating once again instability
within 2-3 seconds of switching.
C. Concurrent Switching
We next consider the scenario in which an opponent simultaneously
corrupts the breakers corresponding to Line 26-28
(Switch 1) and Line 28-29 (Switch 2) of Fig. 1 and targets Generator
9 once again to induce instability. The opponent is assumed
to employ and for attack
as in Section IV-B. Fig. 11 illustrates the corresponding effects
on the system when concurrent switching is applied starting at
10 s for only a 1 second duration. Instability is clearly evident
in frequency, angle, and voltage. It should be noted that the use
of both switches in contrast to either single switch for attack results
in faster instability with a shorter switch duration.
D. Progressive Switching
In this case we consider corruption of breakers on Line 02-25
(Switch 1) and Line 28-29 (Switch 2) with target Generator 8.
Although it can be shown that an individual sliding mode does

not exist for Switch 2, it does for Switch 1. Thus we employ progressive
switching starting with Switch 1. We assume an opponent
employs and and Switch
1 begins at 10.0 s and Switch 2 joins at 10.5 s appropriately coordinating
with Switch 1. Fig. 12 demonstrates the effectiveness
of the approach for system destabilization.
E. Cascading Failure
Traditionally, cascading failure analysis focuses on steady
state system characteristics about an initial equilibrium state
using static power flow methods; dynamic analysis is considered
in general to be difficult to model and complex to assess.
In this section we aim to address cascading failures dynamically
but in the context of our proposed multi-switch analysis
framework. We consider how corruption of a subset of breakers
within the New England 10-machine test system of Fig. 1 can
be exploited to strain the system sufficiently to result in a sequence
of trips and failures resulting in the loss of a substantial
amount of load. We model the presence of protection as detailed
in [17]-[19]. The overload protection on transmission lines is

assumed to trigger when the active power over a line is more
than 800 MW for 5 seconds.
We consider the corruption of Line 26-28 (Switch 1), Line
28-29 (Switch 2). In the first phase of the attack, an opponent
targets Generator 9 employing and
. After Generator 9 is tripped by protection devices,
a second phase is applied. Here, the opponent targets Generator
8 employing and . The
attack results in a series of critical component trips and a resulting
domino effect presented in Table II and Fig. 13. Eventually,
the entire system works under power provided by Generator
10 only, which is clearly sufficient to meet the normal
demand requirements.
An opponent only needs to apply switching from 10 s to 11
s and 20 s to 21 s to have devastating effects within 100 s even
with the use of protection. This impact is significant in contrast
to use of a single switch and demonstrates the potential of
coordinated variable structure switching attacks for large-scale
system disruption.

F. Discussion
In our empirical results, we have presented switch statuses to
demonstrate the switching action required by circuit breakers.
Questions natural arise as to the feasibility of switching at the
dense rates demonstrated in plots such as Figs. 12(e) and (f).
Upon closer inspection, a zoomed-in plot of Figs. 12(e) and
(f), shown in Figs. 14(a) and (b) respectively, demonstrate the
connect and trip pulses required by a circuit breaker for the
switching attack between time instants 10 s and 11 s. Tables III
and IV detail the switch times numerically. As shown in the tables,
the smallest interval for a breaker to connect after a trip
is 16 ms. Moreover, the breaker must be capable of frequent
on-and-off operation.
We provide a brief review of circuit breaker technology that
has the potential to be applicable to the switching attacks detailed
in this paper. Fast operation breakers, suitable for the frequent
action, characteristic of our attack, include air blast circuit
breakers [20] and SF breakers [21] for high voltage (e.g.,
345 kV) systems such as the 39-bus test system employed in the

paper. For both types of breakers, the air/gas is compressed to
enable high velocity flow to dissipate arcing quickly as needed
by our attack. Within arc interruption technology, the classic
synchronous air blast circuit breaker proposed by FUJI Electric
[22] can extinguish the arc in 1.2 ms, comparably faster than
non-synchronous interruption; we expect that the duty cycles
of current technology have become considerably faster than reported
thus enabling switching attacks. The ultra-fast earthing
switch (UFES) produced by ABB in 2011 is capable of extinguishing
arc fault within 4 ms, compared to traditional protection
which takes 140 ms [23], [24]. These specifications fulfill
the 16 ms minimum timing requirement.
More recently, focus as been placed on the development of
semiconductor-enabled solid-state breakers [25], in which there
is no mechanical component, in order to perform higher frequency
operation. Here, arc interruption is inherently integrated.
We assert that such technology, currently under development,
is very suitable for application of our switching attack. Thus,
we conclude that there are strong indications within current

breaker specifications and future goals that our proposed attack
has strong practical application. One avenue of future work
will be to investigate the feasibility of applying the attack to
solid-state circuit breaker apparatuses.
V. FINAL REMARKS AND FUTURE WORK
In this environment of rushed development and rapid deployment,
we contend that there is a timely and critical need for research
that takes a systematic view of smart grid vulnerability
analysis and protection in order to provide engineering principles
of more general use. This paper presented a worst-case scenario
for a multi-switch attack making use of variable structure
system theory for power system disruption. We have demonstrated
the utility of employing multiple switches for creating
transient instability in target generators of a power grid.
Future work will focus on developing analytical bounds on
the time to “catastrophe” in the presence of ideal and non-ideal
inter-attacker communications. Based on these results we
will aim develop adaptive distributed control strategies that

aim to minimize damage through effective system reconfiguration
such as islanding. Moreover, we will aim to identify
peer-to-peer-type strategies within groups of microgrid systems
to rebalance and create resilience to switching attacks. Another
avenue of future work will identify strategies to measure the
effectiveness of a multi-switch attack to identify optimal values
of the sliding mode coefficient matrix .
