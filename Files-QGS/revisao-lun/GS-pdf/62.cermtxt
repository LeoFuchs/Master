Abstract-State estimation in electric power grid is vulnerable to
false data injection attacks, and diagnosing such kind of malicious
attacks has significant impacts on ensuring reliable operations for
power systems. In this paper, the false data detection problem is
viewed as a matrix separation problem. By noticing the intrinsic
low dimensionality of temporal measurements of power grid states
as well as the sparse nature of false data injection attacks, a novel
false data detection mechanism is proposed based on the separation
of nominal power grid states and anomalies. Two methods, the
nuclear norm minimization and low rank matrix factorization, are
presented to solve this problem. It is shown that proposed methods
are able to identify proper power system operation states as well
as detect the malicious attacks, even under the situation that collected
measurement data is incomplete. Numerical simulation results
both on the synthetic and real data validate the effectiveness
of the proposed mechanism.

I. INTRODUCTION
I integration between cyber assets and physical infrastrucN
THE electric power grid we are observing more and more
ture for generation, transmission, and distribution control. The
ever-increasing demand for reliable, sustainable and economical
electricity services necessitate near real-time monitoring
and control in power system operations [1]. However, the security
and reliability of power grid are not guaranteed at all
the times and some failures can cause significant problems for
the producers and consumers of electricity. For example, the
2003 Northeast power blackout [2] showed that even a small
failure in a part of the grid (In this case, a single transmission
line outage in northern Ohio) has cascading effects causing billions
of dollars in economic losses. Nowadays, the integration of
physical and cyber components gives rise to cyber-attack threats
in a power grid, which can result into power outages and even

system blackouts [3], or huge economical loss due to non-optimal
operations of the power grid.
State estimation [4], which estimates the power system operation
state based on a real-time electric network model, is a
key function of the Energy Management System (EMS). A linearized
measurement model is often used to estimate the states
in the power system based on the measurements from remote
meters on buses or transmission lines. Specifically, every several
seconds or minutes, the Energy Control Center (ECC) collects
active/reactive power flows and injections from transmission
lines and buses around the power system as measurement
data via a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)
system. The state estimation results reflect the real-time power
grid operation state and are essential for operators to make decisions
in order to maintain security and stability of the system.
The accuracy of state estimation can be affected by bad measurements
in the electric power grid. Bad data could be due to
topology errors in the grid, untended measurement abnormalities
caused by meter failures, and malicious attacks. To detect
and identify bad measurements in the power grid state, techniques
based on the statistical test on measurement residuals
[4] are developed and widely used. However, [5] reveals the fact
that false data injection attacks are able to circumvent traditional
detection methods based on residual testing. By exploiting the
configuration of a power system, synchronized data injection
attacks on meters can be launched to tamper with their measurements.
What's more, attack vectors can be systematically
and efficiently constructed even when the attacker is limited in
the resources required to comprise meters, which will mislead
the state estimation process, and thus affect the power grid control
algorithms. Hence, sufficient attention should be paid to the
vulnerability of state estimation to false data injection attacks,
which may cause catastrophic consequences in power gird.
Unveiling false data injection attacks is crucial to the security
and reliability of power systems. This task is challenging,
since attackers may be able to construct false data attack vectors
against the protection scheme, and inject attack vectors into
power grid that can bypass the traditional methods for bad measurement
detection. Furthermore, the incomplete measurement
data due to intended attacks or meter failures complicate the task
of malicious attack detection, and thus make state estimation
even more difficult. The effects of false data injection attacks
have been studied in [5]-[7]. False data injection attacks are
presented in [5] against state estimation in electric power grid.
By capitalizing the configuration of power system, malicious
attacks can be launched to bypass the existing bad measurement
detection techniques and manipulate the results of state

estimation arbitrarily. [6], [7] demonstrated that false data injection
attacks are able to circumvent the bad data identification
techniques equipped in an EMS, and could lead to congestion
of transmission lines as well as profitable financial misconduct
in the power market. [8]-[10] also consider the false information
injection attack in power systems. [8] and [10] consider the
time synchronization attack in smart grid, and [9] investigates
the load distribution attacks in power system.
On the other hand, the protection scheme against false data
injection attacks are investigated in [11]-[18]. [11] introduces
two security indices to describe the difficulty of performing a
successful false data injection attack against particular physical
topology of power grid and available measurements. [12]
proposes an efficient method for computing the security index
for sparse attack vectors, and describes a protection scheme to
strengthen system security by placing encrypted devices in the
electric power grid appropriately. [13] models and analyzes this
situation as a zero-sum game between the attacker and defender.
[14] characterizes two kinds of malicious attacks on electric
power grid: the strong attack regime, in which false data injection
attacks exist, and the weak attack regime, in which the
generalized likelihood radio test can be used as a detector. [15]
formulates the bad data detection problem as low-rank matrix
recovery problem, which is solved by convex optimization that
minimizes a combination of the nuclear norm and the norm.
However, [15] just proposed the nuclear norm minimization approach
to solve the problem and did not take the effect of incomplete
measurement into consideration. In [16], a low-complexity
attacking strategy is designed to construct sparse false data injection
attack vectors, and strategic protection schemes are also
proposed based on greedy approaches. [17] gives a thorough
survey of existing detection methods for false data injection attacks
on smart power gird, and [18] studies the fundamental
limits of cyber-physical security in presence of false data injection
attacks in the system.
In this paper, instead of considering the measurement of
electric grid states at an isolated time instance, a novel mechanism
is presented to determine false data injection attacks in
electric power grid. Two characteristics of power grid states are
exploited in the proposed mechanism. Firstly, the attack-free
power grid states are inherently of a low dimension structure
due to the intrinsic temporal correlations of measurement. Secondly,
the false data injection attack vectors are sparse because
attackers are either constrained to some specific measurement
meters or limited in the resources required to compromise
the meters persistently. Hence, the problem of detecting false
data injection attacks can be formulated as a matrix separation
problem. Two methods are proposed to solve this problem:
the nuclear norm minimization method, which offers provable
optimality and convergence rate, and the low rank matrix
factorization approach, which provides better scalability. The
proposed algorithms are bad data detection methods and can
be integrated in the main bad data detection routine of the state
estimator. Every time the EMS performs the state estimation
task, the state estimator of the system will launch the bad data
detection routine, in which the proposed algorithms can be
used to detect and identify malicious attacks, even with partial
collected measurements. Numerical tests on both synthetic and
real data are performed on the proposed algorithm. The proposed
detection algorithm is tested on both IEEE case studies
and Polish networks [19] during winter 2007-2008 evening
peak conditions.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The system
model and false data injection attcks are addressed in Section II.
Section III formulates the malicious attack detection problem
and adopts two proposed methods to solve it. The numerical
results are given in Section IV. Finally, conclusion closes the
paper in Section V.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
A. State Estimation in Power Systems
A power system can be divided into three parts: generation,
transmission, and distribution. In an electric power grid, the
control center needs to monitor the voltage phase angles of all
buses to make real-time decisions on operations. However, it is
impractical to directly measuring all bus voltage phase angles.
In this regard, the control center collects the readings from remote
electric meters to estimate the system operation state. Specific
measurement data include branch active power flows and
bus active power injections, which can be used to estimate bus
voltage angles in the system.
Generally, let denote the power system
state variables. The measurement at the control center is expressed
as and related to by
where , and is a nonlinear
function relating the th measurement to the state vector
. The vector stands for the independent Gaussian measurement
errors with zero mean and known covariance .
To analyze the efficiency of various state estimation methods
solely related to the measurement configuration in a power
system, a simplified DC approximation model is utilized.
Assuming that the bus voltage magnitudes are already known
and normalized, and neglecting all shunt elements and branch
resistances, the active power flow from bus to bus can be
approximated1 [20] by the first order Taylor expansion as:
(1)
(2)
(3)
where is the reactance of the of the transmission line between
bus and bus , is the phase angle at bus , and is the
measurement error. Similarly, a power injection measurement
at a give bus can be expressed as:
where
stands for the measurement error.
1In general, one can approximate the impedance of a transmission line with
its reactance due to the high reactance over resistance ( ratio)
Let
residuals can be expressed as:
, and then the measurement
where is the identity matrix and the matrix (I-K) is called the
residual sensitivity matrix.
The detection and identification of bad data in measurements
can be accomplished by processing of the measurement residuals.
Specifically, the -Test can be applied on the measurement
residuals to detect bad data. Upon detection of bad data,
two kinds of methods, named the largest normalized residual
test and hypothesis testing identification method, can be used to
identify the specific measurement data that actually contain bad
data [4].
B. False Data Injection Attacks
The malicious attack vectors are able to circumvent existing
statistical tests for bad data detection if the measurement residuals
are unchanged. One such example is the false data injection
attack, which is defined as follows:
Definition 1: (False Data Injection Attack) [5]: The malicious
attack vector is called the false
data injection attack if and only if can be expressed as a linear
combination of the columns of as .
Once the false data injection attacks are applies to the power
system, the collected measurements at the ISO can be expressed
as:
Suppose the state estimate using the malicious measurement
is , the measurement residuals in this case is:
which means measurement residuals are unaffected by the injection
attack vector , and the attacker successfully trick the
system into believing that the true state is instead
of . Note that is the attack vector that under the control of attackers,
and reflects the estimation error induced by . A unified
formulation for constructing attack vectors of this problem
can be found in [16].

In practice, the attacker is either constrained to some specific
measurement meters or limited in the resources required to compromise
the meters persistently, which will result in a sparse
attack vector . Moreover, the power system is maintained regularly,
which makes the attack to a great amount of meters impractical.
Furthermore, the utilization of phasor measurement
units (PMU) can improve the performance of false data injection
detection. On one hand, PMUs can provide accurate measurements
of bus voltage angles and power flows to the control
center. On the other hand, they can reduce the number of comprised
measurements in the grid, which will result in a sparse
attack vector . These also make it possible for the proposed
formulation to be extended to a more general framework for detecting
false data injection attacks in power grid. In this paper,
we focus on the detection and identification of sparse false data
injection attacks.
III. PROPOSED ALGORITHM
In this section, we show that the detection and identification
of false data injection attacks in electric power grid can be formulated
as a low rank matrix separation problem. Two methods,
the nuclear norm minimization and low rank matrix factorization,
are proposed to solve this problem.
A. Sparse Optimization Problem Formulation
Assume the measurement of the electric power system observed
by the ISO at time is denoted as . In presence of false
data injection attacks, the measurement is contaminated by
the attack vector . Denote as
the measurement of the power state for a time period of , and
as the false data attacks matrix.
The obtained temporal observations can be expressed as:
Remark that gradually changing power system state variables
will typically lead to a low-rank measurement matrix . In addition,
due to the capability limitation of the attacker, the attacks
are either constrained to some specific measurement meters
or unable to compromise measurement meters persistently.
Hence, only a small fraction of the observations are supposed to
be anomalous at a given time instant. These imply that the false
data injection matrix is sparse across both rows and columns.
By a little abuse of notation, we use stands for the
rank of matrix , and represents the number of nonzero
entries of matrix . Noticing the intrinsic structures of and
, the detection and identification of false data injection attacks
can be converted to a matrix separation problem as:
Hence, the DC model for the real power measurement can be
written in a linear matrix form as:
where is the measurement vector includes active power flows
and injection measurement, and is the Jacobian matrix
of power system known to the independent system operator
(ISO).
The measurements used for state estimation are obtained by
the electric meters and collected by the energy control center.
Suppose the measurement errors in (4) are not correlated, and
thus the covariance matrix is a diagonal matrix. The Weighted
Least Square estimator of the linearized state vector is given
by:
Solving (10) distinguishes the power state measurement matrix
and sparse attack matrix from their sum . Considering
the missing measurements due to the meter failures or communication
links outage in practical applications, (10) can be formulated
as:

(10)
(11)
where is an index subset, and is the projection operator.
Specifically, is the projection of a matrix onto the
subspace of matrices whose non-zeros entries are restricted to
as:
In the next two subsections, we propose two methods to solve
this problem.
B. Nuclear Norm Minimization
The optimization problem in (10) characterizes the low rank
property of anomaly power state measurement matrix as
well as sparse nature of malicious attacks . However, it is
known impractical to directly solve (10). One possible approach
is replacing and with their their convex relaxation,
and , respectively. is the nuclear norm
of , which is the sum of its singular values, and is the
norm of , which is the sum of absolute values of its entries.
Hence, (10) is reformulated as the following convex optimization
problem:

can be formulated as:
Algorithm 1 Nuclear Norm Minimization Approach
The optimization problem in (14) has been extensively
studied in the fields of compressive sensing [21] and matrix
completion [22], [23], and can be solved by many off-the-shelf
convex optimization algorithms. Motivated by [24], an algorithm

multipliers is utilized here to detect the false data matrix as
well as recover the measurement matrix .
The augmented Lagrange multipliers are used to solve the

problem in (15) can be solved in an iterative way via the
method of augmented Lagrange multipliers. More details about
the augmented Lagrange multipliers technique can be found in
[25].

where (18) can be explicitly computed from the soft-shrinkage
formula, and (19) can be solved via the singular value
shrinkage operator [26]. Specifically, define the operator
for variable , where sgn is
the sign function. This operator can be extended to vectors and
matrices by applying it element-wise. (18) is solved by:
To solve (19), a singular value decomposition (SVD) is applied
on the matrix :
where is a positive constant. The proposed algorithm is illustrated
in Algorithm 1.
It has been proved in [27] that the method of augmented
Lagrange multipliers has a Q-liner converges speed. Also, to
achieve the optimal solution, it is unnecessary to make the
penalty parameter to approach infinity. The analysis of the
convergence of proposed algorithm can be found in [24] and
we include it here for completeness.

Correspondingly, (14) can be rewritten as:
Note that a low-rank matrix factorization is explicitly applied
to instead of minimizing its nuclear norm as in (14), which
avoids singular value decomposition completely. To solve the
minimization problem in (27), the augmented Lagrangian function
is expressed as:
where is a penalty parameter and is the Lagrange multiplier
corresponding to the constraint . Motivated
by the idea in the alternating direction method for convex optimization,
the augmented Lagrangian function can be minimized
with respect to block variables individually as the following
framework in each iteration [28]:

performance of the algorithm.

C. Low Rank Matrix Factorization
The speed and scalability of the nuclear norm minimization
approach are limited by the computational complexity of singular
value decomposition. When the matrix size and rank increase,
the computation operations for singular value decomposition
will become quite expensive. To improve the scalability
of solving large-scale problems of malicious attacks detection
in power systems, an low rank matrix factorization approach is
proposed in this part.

for removing SVD computation, yielding a much improved
scalability for solving large-scale problems. Moreover, Algorithm
2 complements well the nuclear-norm minimization
model in terms of recoverability. The convergence issue of

completeness.

particular, whenever convergence, it converges to a
KKT point of problem (26).
IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS
In this section, numerical simulations are given to evaluate
the performance of the proposed algorithms. Power flow data
for IEEE 57 bus and IEEE 118 bus test cases are used, and the
power flow data for Polish system during winter evening peak
conditions, 2007-2008 are also used for the scalability test of
proposed algorithms.
Assume the loads on each bus in the power system are uniformly
distributed between 50% and 150% of its base load.
When the state estimation measurements are collected, a small
portion of the measurement data are compromised by malicious
attackers with an arbitrary amount of injection data, and
is defined as the attack ratio here. The methods for false data injection
attacks construction can be found in [14], [16]. Here, we
focus on the protection scheme and suppose the locations of the
attack are chosen randomly and last a period of .2 Totally a
number of T time instances measurements are obtained for analysis.
The receiver operating characteristic analysis is first given,
where the true positive rate and false alarm rate are defined, respectively,
as follows:
where is the number of successful detections of malicious
attacks, is the number of miss detections. is the
number of false alarms, and is the number of correct
reports of no attack. Then, we investigate the performance of
proposed algorithms under different missing measurement ratios
as well as attack ratios. Finally, we evaluate the scalability
of the algorithm.
A. Receiver Operating Characteristic Analysis
First we analyze the receiver operating characteristics (ROC)
of the proposed algorithms, and compare their performances
with the principle component analysis (PCA)3 based detection
method. In this part, the attack ratio is fixed at and
.
2Note that the attack vectors used in this paper are more general compare to
[14], [16] and will not affect the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.
3For PCA, we remain the largest singular values of the matrix such that

PCA-base method. .
The ROC curves for IEEE 57 bus and IEEE 118 bus cases are
depicted in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, respectively. From the figures, it is
apparent that the proposed algorithms can detect the false data
accurately at a low false alarm rate. For example in case IEEE 57
bus system, the true positive rate of nuclear norm minimization
is 93% and 95% for low rank matrix factorization when false
alarm rate . Tests in case IEEE 118 bus system have
similar results. Moreover, the low rank matrix factorization approach
performs slightly better than the nuclear norm minimization
method. The reason for this phenomena is model-related,
and in this case, the sparse attack matrix is not the dominant
part in measurements, which makes the low rank matrix factorization
approach more suitable. Fig. 1 and in Fig. 2 show that
the proposed algorithms outperform the PCA-based approach

much. The PCA method do not take the corruptions of malicious
attacks in to consideration. Even though the matrix is
low rank, the sum of and will not be low rank any more.
Directly apply the PCA method will result in a poor performance.
Different from the PCA, proposed algorithms exploits
the low rank structure of the anomaly-free measurement matrix,
and the fact that malicious attacks are quite sparse, which
renders a better performance.
B. Performance vs. Missing Measurement Ratio
In this part, we assume a portion of the measurements collected
at the control center is missing due to the meter failures
or communication links outage, and evaluate the performance of
proposed algorithms under different missing measurement ratios
till 10% on IEEE 118 bus system. The attack ratio is fixed
at and .
The ROC curves for IEEE 118 bus case are depicted in Fig. 3.
From the figure we can see that with 10% missing measurements,
the proposed algorithms are still able to detect the malicious
attacks in power system at acceptable true positive rates,
and the low rank matrix factorization method performs slightly
better. Compare with Fig. 2, we can see the missing measurements
actually deteriorate the performance of proposed algorithms.
Since the PCA-based method is unable to detect the
anomalies in this case, we omitted the simulation result here.
Note that the existence of missing entries will result in an incorrect
estimation of low-dimensional space of matrix , which
leads to the failure of PCA.
To investigate the performance under different missing
measurement ratios, the percentage of missing measurements
is varied from 0% (no missing measurements) to 10%, and the
results are shown in Fig. 4. The true positive rates are calculated
for both algorithms when the false alarm rate equals 10%. It
is shown that the performance is monotonously improved as
more and more measurements are collected. At the worst case
when 10% of measurements are missing, the proposed algorithms
can still achieve a true positive rate of 85% and 90% for
nuclear norm minimization and low rank matrix factorization,
respectively.

A more detailed demonstration of the proposed algorithms'
recoverability for power system states is shown in Fig. 5. Assume
10% measurements are missing and , the
cumulative distribution functions of relative reconstruction errors
at and are calculated. The relative reconstruction
error is defined as:
(37)
where denotes the componentwise division, and calculates
the absolute value of each element in vector . The is in
radian units which is obtained from the recovered , and the
vector calculates the relative error of each component in the
state vector . We calculate the relative error for each bus in the
system, and plot the cumulative distribution function. From the
figures we can see that the proposed algorithms are able to reconstruct
the power system states quite accurately. At ,
majority of the relative errors focus between interval [ 0.1 0.1],
and similar results are shown at . These imply that the

proposed algorithms are able to precisely detect the malicious
attacks as well as accurately estimate power system states, even
under the severe situation of partial measurements.
C. Performance vs. Attack Ratio
In this section, the attack ratio of attack vector is varied to
evaluate the performance of proposed algorithms in IEEE 118
bus system. The is varied from 5% to 15%, and .
From Fig. 6, the true positive rate is quite high at low sparsity
ratio for both proposed algorithms. Particularly, when the sparsity
ratio is 5%, the true positive rates are 93.6% and 94.3% at
for nuclear norm minimization and low rank matrix
factorization, respectively. Compared with the PCA-based
method, the performance of the proposed algorithms are quite
stable as the attack ratio increases. When the attack ratio
reaches 15%, the true positive rates for both algorithms are still
around 90%. The true positive rates of proposed algorithms
will decrease dramatically when attackers attack the power
system massively. It is because that when the attack matrix are
not sparse enough, the mixed-norm minimization is not able to
separate the low rank anomaly-free matrix and attack matrix.
D. Performance on Large Scale System
Finally we analyze the scalability and computational efficiency
of proposed algorithms on power flow data for Polish
system during winter peak conditions 2007-2008, and compare
their performances with the PCA-based detection method. In
this part, the attack ratio is fixed at and .
The ROC curve is shown in Fig. 7. It is shown in the figure
that the performance of proposed algorithms is quite stable on
the large scale system compare to the IEEE 57 bus system and
IEEE 118 bus system. The comparison on the computational
efficiency of two proposed algorithms are shown in Fig. 8. The
data matrix row dimension is varied from 100 to 3400, and is
increased by 300 rows each time. The proposed algorithms are
performed on the subset of the measurement matrix each time,
and the CPU computation time is logged. It is shown in Fig. 8
that as the dimension of the measurement matrix increases, the
CPU time for computation will increase, and the low rank matrix

factorization approach performs better than the nuclear norm
minimization method, which demonstrates a better scalability
to large problems.
The numerical results validate the effectiveness of proposed
algorithm. According to the simulation results, Both the low
rank matrix factorization technique and nuclear norm minimization
technique can solve the matrix separation problem, and
the performance of the low rank matrix factorization is slightly
better than nuclear norm minimization technique. From the perspective
of recoverability, since the false data attack matrix
is not the dominant part compared with in this setting, the
performance of ow rank matrix factorization technique is better.
From the perspective of computation time, the low rank matrix
factorization technique possesses a solution speed much faster
than the nuclear-norm minimization due to its SVD-free feature.
A detailed comparison of two algorithms is out the scope of this
paper. A detail discussion can be found in reference [28].

V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we propose a mechanism that exploits the temporal
correlation of the time-series state measurements, as well
as the sparse nature of the malicious attacks, to detect the false
data injection in power grid. The false data detection problem is
formulated as the matrix separation problem. Two methods, the
nuclear norm minimization method and low rank matrix factorization
method, are proposed to recover the electric power
states as well as detect the malicious attacks in the power grid.
The proposed methods can also deal with missing measurements.
Numerical simulations are performed to evaluate the performance
of proposed algorithms. The effects of the missing
measurement ratio, attack ratio and dimension of measurements
are also analyzed. Simulation results are compared with the
PCA-based detection method and validate the effectiveness of
proposed algorithms.
