Abstract-In a smart grid, the strong coupling between cyber
and physical operations makes power systems vulnerable to cyber
attacks. Changing the traditional structure of power systems and
integrating communication devices are beneficial for better monitoring
and decisionmaking by System Operators but increases
the chance of being maliciously attacked. The communication
links can be hacked so that the attacker can alter the power flow
and power injection measurements, which are used to estimate
the states of power system. In this paper, we formulate an attack
strategy that can change the congestion of transmission lines
without being detectable. Moreover, the financial benefit in an
Ex-Post market is also investigated. Simulation results on an
IEEE 30-Bus test system shows both the changes of congestion
and the potential financial benefit gained by an attacker.

I. INTRODUCTION
Due to increase in electricity demand and limited energy
resources, power systems become more and more complex
in structure and should operate in a secure and optimal conditions.
The difAfter deregulation, the physical and financial
operations of electric power systems become significantly
different and challenging. State estimation (SE), introduced
to improve the operating point of the power system from
both technical and economical viewpoints, helped engineers
in energy control centers (ECC) to monitor all states of
the power system, which was previously not practical (or
economical) to monitor. Currently, SE plays an important
rule in secure and optimal operation of power systems [1],
[2]. Accuracy of state estimation can be affected by bad
data in measurements. These bad data could be caused by
unintended measurement abnormalities or topology errors, or
even by injection of malicious attacks. Cyber-attacks can be
increased by integrating more advanced cyber technologies
into the energy management system (EMS) and can cause
major technical problems such as blackouts in a power system.
These attacks also can be designed for illicit financial benefit
by changing the optimal operation of the system, thereby
increasing the net cost of electricity for consumers.
A cyber attack in 2003, caused a blackout in the eastern US
and Canada [3]. This attack alarmed cyber-security decision
makers motivating them to define critical infrastructure that is
vulnerable to cyber-attack. In 2007, researchers at the Idaho
National Lab tried to attack a synchronous generator. This
attack was successful and the generator was self-destroyed
in a couple of minutes [4]. In [5], analysis of cyber-security
vulnerabilities of a supervisory control and data acquisition
(SCADA) center is done at three levels: system, scenario,
and access points. In [6], an undetectable attack by bad
data detectors (BDD) was first introduced, where the attacker
knows the state estimation Jacobian matrix (H) and defines
an undetectable attack using this matrix. In [7], it is shown
that even if the attacker does not know this matrix, similar
undetectable attack can be inserted by independent component
analysis. In [8], a security measure is defined to quantify how
hard attacks are to perform, and then an efficient algorithm
is constructed to compute the security measure. Potential
financial misconduct that may be induced from cyber attack
was discussed in reference paper [9].
In this paper we show that attacker can compromise measurements
and insert false data into state estimation. This
attack will be undetectable and stealthy enough to defeat
traditional bad data detection methods and able to change
the transmitted power in transmission lines. This change can
increase or decrease the congestion level in the attacked lines,
which in a market-based environment will change the price of
congestion and Locational Marginal Prices. Our contribution
is that the optimization problems are formulated to link the
stealthy attack, power congestion and market prices. The
simulation results on IEEE 30-Bus test system shows the
changing of the line congestion by a stealthy attack, which
provides the financial benefits to attacker.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The system
model and basic concepts of power system state estimation
and false data injection are introduced in Section II. Section
III describes the false data injection problem. A rational attack
is formulated from the attacker point of view in Section IV.
The structure of the electricity market and the incentive for
formulated attack is presented in Section V. A formulated
attack is tested on an IEEE-30 bus test system and the results
are presented in Section VI. For the sake of clarity, we
show the abbreviations and notations in Table I and Table II,
respectively.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
In power systems, transmission lines transfer complex
power from generating units to load centers. As described by
circuit theory, this power is a function of line impedance1 and
1Transmission lines have high reactance over resistance (i.e. X=R ratio),
and one can approximate the impedance of a transmission line with its
reactance.

where Vi is the voltage magnitude, i is the voltage phase

form of (1) should be used which, can be obtained by:

this approximation assumes that amplitudes of voltages in
buses are near unity and the difference of phase angles for
two buses is small [11].
In power systems, measuring active power in a line (or
injected active power in buses) is much easier than measuring
angles. On the other hand, a control center needs to monitor
angles of each bus in order to make corrective decisions
for real-time operation of the system. In this regard, control
centers try to use as many measurements as possible (redundant
measurement) to have a better estimation during system
monitoring. The linear approximation model of measurement
vector z = [z1; ; zm]T can be described as:
z = H
+ e;
where = [ 1; : : : ; n]T is the state vector2, H is the
Jacobian matrix of the power system and e = [e1; ; em]T
2In power flow studies, the voltage phase angle ( i) of the reference bus
is fixed and known, and thus only n 1 angles need to be estimated.

State estimation in power systems usually refers to finding
best estimate of state vector from measurement vector z. In
(3), the number of equations (the number of measurements)
are more than the number of unknown (state variables). These
equations can be solved with Weighted Least Squares (WLS)

a power system, where PMU stands for phasor measurement
unit. The measurements are obtained for each transmission
line3 and are reported to control center for the state estimation
in (4).
III. BAD DATA IN STATE ESTIMATION
The measured data can be faulty because of measurement
abnormalities or malicious bad data injection [6]. These measurements
have direct impact on state estimation functions in
power system monitoring. In order to detect the false data or
faulty measurements, the control center uses different routines
such as the 2 method4 and the maximum residue vector
method [1] that we will discuss next.
A. Detection of False Data Injection
After estimation of angles using (4), the residue vector r can
be computed as the difference between the measured quantity
z and the calculated value z^ from the estimated state:

defined as super-composition of lines power which are connected to the
measured bus. For example injected active power to bus i is Pi = Pj Pij .

results is significant or not.
where is the threshold and ri is the ith component of r. If
the condition in (6) is not satisfied, the alarm is triggered for
the false data in the ith measurement.
B. Stealth (Unobservable) Attack
Recently, a certain type of attack was introduced by [6],
which is not detectable by max residue vector r. In this attack,
an attacker with knowledge of topology H, can add zatt = Ha
to z0 (the measurement vector without attack). As a result,
z = z0 + zatt = z0 + Ha:
Substituting (7) in (4) gives:
where ^0 = Mz0 and
Substituting (7) and (9) in (5), we have
^ = ^0 + a;
z^ = H ^ = H ^0 + Ha:
r = z
z^ = z0

s.t.
Equation (10) shows that residue r will not be affected by
the injected attack vector to measurements, since the resulting
r has the same mean and variance as before attack. As a
result, the hypothesis test fails in detecting the attacker. In
fact, the control center believes that the true state is 0 + a.
Consequently, this is called stealth false data injection.
IV. ATTACK AGAINST VOLTAGE ANGLES IN STATE
ESTIMATION
As described in Section III, if the control center cannot
detect the attacked measurements, the results of state estimation
will be incorrect and have negative effects on the
control center decisions. In this section, we will show that the
attacker can compromise the measurement vector and change
the state of the system. Change in transmitted power can
modify congestion levels, which are closely related to the price
at which electricity trades in most markets. We formulate the
problem to increase or decrease transmitted active power in the
desired transmission lines by injecting bad data as follows:

The objective of the above optimization is to decrease and
increase transmitted power, respectively, in group M and N
of transmission lines represented by fijg. Hij are rows of H
corresponding to each line fijg, in which the attacker would
like to decrease or increase transmitted power5. ^ is a function
5From (1), transmitted power in some of lines could be negative which
means the direction of power flow is opposite of primary assumed direction.
Congestion in these lines means the active power flow wants to be less
than minimum value which is specified in the OPF program. For removing
congestion in these lines, attacker needs to maximize the power flow in the
primary assumed direction in (11).

of attacking parameter a in (8). The two constraints impose
limitations on injected measurement and total cost of attack,
respectively, where Catt is a vector representing the cost of
attacking each line. Optimization problem in (11) tries to
change the estimated transmitted power in the system (without
triggering the bad data detection alarm). In order to describe
potential benefits for the attacker, the following section will
briefly introduce the structure of electricity market.
V. EX-ANTE AND EX-POST ELECTRICITY MARKET
Optimal and secure operation of a power system is an
important goal for ISO. In this regard, ISO needs to find the
best schedule of generation and consumption6. This schedule
considers transmission lines capacities, limitations in rate
and capacity of generators, and security considerations. As a
result, ISO may run different scheduling or optimization programs
such as Power Flow (PF), Optimal Power Flow (OPF),
Security Constrained Optimal Power Flow (SCOPF), Economic
Dispatch, and Security Constrained Economic Dispatch
(SCED) [12], [13], [14]. DC optimal power flow (DCOPF) is
linear format of OPF that ISO usually uses for calculating the
Locational Marginal Prices (LMPs)7.
In the Ex-Ante model, the generation dispatches and LMPs
are obtained from the same optimization model. In the Ex-Post
model, the dispatch is performed at Ex-Ante, while the LMP
is calculated after the cycle of the spot market, i.e., at Ex-Post
such as after the 5-minute or hourly real-time market, using
an incremental dispatch model [15]. The problem formulation
of DCOPF is given by

where CG is bid vector for supplying active power, CD
is bid vector for consumption of active power, PG is the
active power generation vector in Mega-Watts (MWs), PD is
the active power consumption vector in Mega-Watts (MWs),
FL = H is the vector of transmitted active power, and B
is defined as Bij = X1ij and Bii = Pjn=1 X1ij . The first
constraint of this optimization shows the balance between
generation and consumption of active power in each bus.
The second, third, and fourth constraints consider the thermal
limitation in transmission lines, active power generation limits,
and active power consumption limits, respectively. There are
different uncertainties in actual operating states for all power
systems such as load forecast uncertainty and unpredicted
line or generator outages. These changes can be considered
in a real-time market (Ex-Post market), which uses similar

and consume electricity respectively.

optimization procedure to cover the latest changes in the power
system.

We try to solve the linear optimization problem in (12) by
the Lagrangian method. The Lagrangian multiplier for the first
constraint in (12) is called the LMP, which could be obtained
by:
LMPi =
8i = 1; :::; n;
(13)
where Pi = Pgi Pdi . LMP at bus i reflects the magnitude
of change in cost function because of one unit change in the
amount of active power in bus i. So, this value can be used
as the price of electricity in each bus. In order to decrease the
total cost of operation (f ), the optimization problem in (12)
will dispatch generators in an orderly fashion, starting with
those with a low price and incrementally selecting those with
higher prices. In this procedure, the last dispatched generator8
will define LMP because the active power change in each bus
will be provided by this generator so that the LMP will be the
same in all buses. But in the case of congestion, this change
will be covered by several marginal generators so that the LMP
will be different in buses.
In addition to benefiting financially, an attacker could also
cause power system blackout. Practically, a transmission line
has different types of protecting relays. For example, in the
case of overloading (e.g., the results of this paper's simulated
attack) special relays will disconnect the line (to prevent overheating
and physical damage). This line outage (especially
during peak hours) would reduce the transmission capacity,
increasing the chance of instability in the power system.
8This generator is usually called âMarginal Generatorâ

VI. SIMULATION RESULTS
In this section, we show the effects of the presented attack
on the IEEE 30-Bus test system shown in Fig. 2. In order to
define LMPs in the Ex-Ante market, the control center solves
DC optimal power flow in (12). This optimization is solved by
Matpower, a package of MATLAB M-files for solving power
flow and optimal power flow problems [16]. The attack targets
line 29 in the power system.
In Fig. 3, we show the voltage angles for different buses
with and without attack. We can see that the phase estimation
is modified without being detected. Consequently, simulation
results show that line 29 (from bus 21 to bus 22) is congested
in Fig. 4. For comparison, we also show in this figure the
case without attack and the thermal limits. As described in
Section V, this congestion changes the marginal generator and
as a consequence, the network will have different LMPs in its
buses as shown in Fig. 5. The financial benefit is given by the
following example.
Releasing congestion can change LMPs, so an attacker
solves (11) and inserts an undetectable attack9. Due to the
stochastic nature of loads, the control center believes that
there is no congestion in the network (for example transmitted
power through line 29, is less than its thermal limit). Based
on these results, the control center will use the free (but fake)
capacity in line 29 and run the Ex-Post program for the realtime
market. This time, because of released congestion, LMPs
will be the same in the network (Fig. 5). If, for example,
attacker buys P MW = 10 at bus 22 in the Ex-Ante market
and sells it in the Ex-Post market in the same bus, the profit
of this transaction will be:
9Practically attacker could insert false data to measurements by, changing
the bias of measurements or hacking and sending the desired values to control
center.

In summary, the attacker can obtain the financial gain through
changing power line congestion by stealthy bad data injection
without being detected.
VII. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we demonstrate the effect of stealthy false data
injection on power system congestion. The problem solution
links stealthy attack, power congestion, and the resulting
market price. We show that by changing congestion, the
attacker can change LMPs and obtain financial benefit in an
Ex-Post market. Besides financial misconduct, the attacker can
also overload specific lines, which consequently increases the
chance of line outages. We test our proposed attack in an
IEEE 30-bus test system using MATPOWER and show the
profitability of such an attack.
