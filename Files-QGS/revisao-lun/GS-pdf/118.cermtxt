Network-Aware Mitigation of Data Integrity
Attacks on Power System State Estimation
Ognjen Vukovic´, Kin Cheong Sou, Gyo¨ rgy Da´n, Henrik Sandberg
Abstract-Critical power system applications like contingency
analysis and optimal power flow calculation rely on the power
system state estimator. Hence the security of the state estimator
is essential for the proper operation of the power system. In
the future more applications are expected to rely on it, so that
its importance will increase. Based on realistic models of the
communication infrastructure used to deliver measurement data
from the substations to the state estimator, in this paper we investigate
the vulnerability of the power system state estimator to
attacks performed against the communication infrastructure. We
define security metrics that quantify the importance of individual
substations and the cost of attacking individual measurements.
We propose approximations of these metrics, that are based on
the communication network topology only, and we compare them
to the exact metrics. We provide efficient algorithms to calculate
the security metrics. We use the metrics to show how various
network layer and application layer mitigation strategies, like
single and multi-path routing and data authentication, can be
used to decrease the vulnerability of the state estimator. We
illustrate the efficiency of the algorithms on the IEEE 118 and
300 bus benchmark power systems.

I. INTRODUCTION
S systems are used to monitor and to control large-scale
UPERVISORY control and data acquisition (SCADA)
power grids. They collect measurement data taken at the
substations, multiplex them in remote terminal units (RTUs)
located at the substations, and deliver the multiplexed data
through the SCADA network to the SCADA master located at
the control center. At the control center the measurement data
are fed into the power system state estimator (SE). The SE is
an on-line application that relies on redundant measurements
and a physical model of the power system to periodically
calculate an accurate estimate of the power system's state [1],
[2]. It includes a Bad Data Detection (BDD) system to detect
faulty measurement data.
The state estimate provided by the SE is the basis for a set
of application specific software, usually called energy management
systems (EMS). Modern EMS provide information
support in the control center for a variety of applications
related to power network monitoring and control. One example
is the optimal routing of power flows in the network, called
optimal power flow (OPF), which is to ensure cost-efficient

operation. Another example is contingency analysis, which
is an essential application to maintain the power system in
a secure and stable state despite potential failures, e.g., by
using the n − 1 security criterion. EMS are also expected to
be integral components of future SmartGrid solutions, hence
the secure and proper operation of the SE is of critical
importance [3], [4].
SCADA systems and communication protocols have traditionally
been designed to be efficient and to be resilient to
failures in order to achieve cost-efficient system operation.
Security has been provided through isolating the SCADA
infrastructure from the public and the corporate infrastructures,
and by following the principle of security by obscurity.
SCADA infrastructures are, however, increasingly integrated
with corporate infrastructures and equipment are often left
unattended, which together with a large installed base of
legacy equipment and protocols implies that SCADA systems
are potentially vulnerable to cyber attacks [4], [5].
An attacker that gains access to the SCADA communication
infrastructure could potentially inject crafted packets or could
manipulate the measurement data sent from the RTUs to the
control center. While the BDD is supposed to detect faulty
measurement data, it was shown recently [6] that measurement
data can be manipulated such that they do not trigger the
BDD system in the SE. We term such corruptions stealth
attacks on the SE. Recent experiments on a SCADA/EMS
testbed [7] indeed verify that large stealth attacks can be
performed without triggering alarms. By fooling the SE the
attacker could manipulate the power markets [8], or could hide
that the power system is in an unsecure state and eventually
can cause cascading failures. The existence of such attacks
and their potential security implications make it important to
understand how such attacks can be mitigated using various
mitigation schemes at a relatively low cost, e.g., without
introducing authentication in all system components.
In this paper we address this important question by proposing
a framework that captures the characteristics of the power
system and of the SCADA communication infrastructure.
Our contributions are twofold. First, we develop quantitative
metrics to assess the importance of substations and communication
equipment with respect to the SE. Second, we use these
metrics to evaluate the potential of various mitigation measures
to decrease the SE's vulnerability to stealth attacks. As mitigation
measures we consider both network layer solutions, such
as single-path and multi-path routing, and application layer
solutions such as data authentication. We use IEEE benchmark
systems to provide numerical results based on the framework.
The framework can be used by SCADA system designers

and operators to assess the vulnerability of their systems and
to evaluate the efficiency of different mitigation schemes to
protect the SCADA state estimator against attacks.
The structure of the paper is as follows. In Section II, we
discuss the related work. In Section III we outline power
system SE and stealth attacks, and a model of modern SCADA
communication infrastructures. In Section IV, we introduce
system security metrics and show how they can be efficiently
computed even for large power systems. In Section V, we
propose an algorithm to mitigate attacks efficiently via various
mitigation measures. In Section VI, we use the proposed
metrics to evaluate the potential of the mitigation measures
to improve security. In Section VII we conclude the paper.
II. RELATED WORK
Since power system state estimation is a core component of
SCADA/EMS systems, there is a wealth of literature on state
estimation and bad data detection algorithms [1], [2].
It has long been known that certain bad data are not
detectable [9], [10]. Still, the first to study state estimation
from a security perspective was [6], where it was pointed
out that measurements can be corrupted so that they do not
trigger the BDD system, even though the measurements are
erroneous. The observation is built on a linearized model of
state estimation, but experiments on a SCADA/EMS testbed
verified the possibility of stealth attacks under nonlinear
models [7].
Several works aimed to quantify the difficulty of performing
stealth attacks against some measurements [6], [11], [12], [13],
[14], [15]. A common assumption among most of these works
is that the measurement values are delivered individually from
the meters to the control center [6], [11], [12], [13], [15].
This assumption, while it simplifies the problem formulation,
ignores the fact that measurement data taken by different
meters at a substation are multiplexed before being sent to
the control center. Multiplexing was treated in [14], [15],
where the authors considered that measurements taken at the
same substation are delivered to the control center over the
same point-to-point communication link. This communication
model still ignores the network topology, and captures only a
fraction of the SCADA communication infrastructures in use
today. We, instead, consider a realistic communication model
where measurement data are multiplexed and may be relayed
through other substations.
Related to our work are studies that use the betweenness
centrality [16] and the vertex connectivity [17] in the context
of network reliability and in the context of security,
respectively. In [18] the authors use the betweenness centrality
to assess the importance of individual nodes in routing
messages. In [19] the authors use the vertex connectivity
to assess network resilience against attacks that compromise
communication nodes and communication links. We provide
a joint treatment of the communication network topology and
stealth attacks against the state estimator, and use these graph
theoretical metrics as a comparison to our security metrics.
In this paper we propose a model of the communication
infrastructure used in modern power transmission systems.
The model accounts for the fact that measurement data can be
delivered from a substation to the control center through pointto-point
links but also via other substations. Hence an attacker
that gains access to a substation, can potentially access and
modify all data that traverse the substation. The combination
of the power flow model with the model of the communication
infrastructure allows us to provide a realistic treatment of
stealth attacks and mitigation schemes for power system SE.
To our knowledge this paper is the first to consider such a
cyber-physical model of power system SE security.
III. BACKGROUND AND SYSTEM MODEL
In this section, we review steady-state power system modeling
and state-estimation techniques, and give an overview of
the communication infrastructure used in SCADA systems.
A. SCADA Communication Infrastructure
Electric power transmission systems extend over large geographical
areas, typically entire countries. Wide-area networks
(WANs) are used to deliver the multiplexed measurement data,
often together with voice, video and other data traffic, from
the RTUs located at the substations to the control center of
the transmission system operator (TSO).
For reliability the WAN communication infrastructure is
usually owned by the TSO, but the public switched telephone
network (PSTN), cellular, and satellite networks are
also used. Historically, the WAN infrastructure consisted of
point-to-point communication links between RTUs and the
control center (e.g., over the PSTN). However, modern WAN
infrastructures are increasingly based on overhead ground wire
(also called optical ground wire, OPGW) installations that
run between the tops of the high voltage transmission towers
or along underground cables. In the latter case, SONET or
SDH is used to establish communication links (called virtual
circuits) between the substations and the control center, but
wide-area Ethernet is expected to become prevalent in the near
future. As an effect the data sent from a remote substation to
the control center might traverse several substations, where
switches, multiplexers or cross connects multiplex the data
from different substations onto a single OPGW link.
To detect bit errors, SCADA communication protocols include
an error detection code calculated by the RTU, which is
sent along with the data. The error detection code can be based
on, e.g., cyclic redundancy check (CRC) or a cryptographic
hash function, such as SHA-1. These codes do not provide
message authentication. The operator can achieve message
authentication by installing a secret key at the substation in one
of two ways. First, by installing a bump-in-the-wire (BITW)
device adjacent to a legacy RTU [20]. Data between the RTU
and the BITW device are sent in plain-text, hence a BITW
does not protect the data if an attacker can gain physical
access to the substation. Nevertheless, it protects the data
between the BITW device and the control center. Second,
by installing an RTU that supports message authentication. A
tamper-proof RTU that supports authentication, though more
expensive, ensures data integrity even if the attacker can gain
physical access to the substation.

B. Power System State Estimation and Stealth Attacks
C. Power System Communication Model
Measurements are taken and sent at a low frequency in
SCADA systems, and therefore steady-state estimators are
used for state estimation. For a complete treatment of this
topic, see for example [1], [2].
Consider a power system that has n + 1 buses. We consider
models of the active power flows Pi j (between bus i and j),
active power injections Pi (at bus i), and bus phase angles δi,
where i, j = 1, . . . , n + 1. (A negative Pi indicates a power load
at bus i.) The state-estimation problem we consider consists
of estimating n phase angles δi given M active power flow
and injection measurement values zm (m ∈ {1, ..., M}). One
has to fix one (arbitrary) bus phase angle as reference angle,
for example δ0 := 0, and therefore only n angles have to be
estimated, i.e., the vector δ = (δ1, δ2, .., δn)T . The active power
flow measurements are denoted by z = (z1, . . . , zM)T , and are
equal to the actual power flow plus independent random measurement
noise e, which we assume has a Gaussian distribution
of zero mean, e = e1, . . . , eM T ∈ N (0, R) where R := EeeT
is the diagonal measurement covariance matrix.
When the phase differences δi − δ j between the buses in the
power system are all small, then a linear approximation, a so
called DC power flow model, is accurate, and we can write
z = Hδ + e,
where H ∈ RM×n is a constant known Jacobian matrix that
depends on the power system topology and the measurements,
see [1], [2] for details. The state estimation problem can then
be solved as
δˆ := (HT R−1H)−1HT R−1z.
The phase-angle estimates δˆ are used to estimate the active
power flows by [2]
zˆ = Hδˆ = H(HT R−1H)−1HT R−1z.
The BDD system uses such estimates to identify faulty sensors
and bad data by comparing the estimate zˆ with z: if the
elements zˆm and zm are very different, an alarm is triggered
because the received measurement value zm is not explained
well by the model. For a more complete treatment of BDD
we refer to [1], [2].
An attacker that wants to change measurement m (its value
zm) might have to change several other measurements m to
avoid a BDD alarm to be triggered. Consider that the attacker
wants to change the measurements from z into za := z + a. The
attack vector a is the corruption added to the real measurement
vector z. As was shown in [6], an attack vector must satisfy
a = Hc, for some c ∈ Rn,
in order for it not to increase the risk of an alarm. The
corresponding a is termed a stealth attack henceforth.
In the recent study [7] it was verified that, despite the
simplifying assumptions, stealth attacks can be made large in
real (nonlinear) SE software: in the example considered in [7],
a power flow measurement was corrupted by 150 MW (57%
of the nominal power flow) without triggering alarms.
The n + 1 buses of the power system are spread over a
set of substations S , |S | = S. We denote the substation at
which measurement m is taken by S(m) ∈ S , and we denote
the substation at which the control center is located by scc ∈ S .
We model the communication network by an undirected graph
G = (S , E); an edge between two substations corresponds to
a communication link between the two substations (e.g., a
point-to-point link from a substation to the control-center,
or an OPGW link between two substations connected by a
transmission line). The graph G is connected but is typically
sparse. Every substation s ∈ S can have multiple established
routes to the control center scc through G . We represent route i
of substation s by the set of substations rsi ⊆ S that it traverses,
including substation s and the control center scc. The order in
which the substations appear in the route is not relevant to
the considered problem. For substation s, we denote the set
of established routes by Rs = {rs1, . . . , rsR(s)}. If R(s) = 1 then
all measurement data from substation s are sent over a single
route to the control center. If R(s) > 1 then unless the data sent
over all routes get corrupted in an appropriate way, the control
center can detect the data corruption. This can be achieved
in a number of ways, e.g., by repeating the measurement
data on all the routes or by appending a checksum calculated
(1) using an error detection code or a cryptographic hash function,
and splitting the data among all the routes. We denote the
collection of all Rs by R .
We consider two forms of end-to-end authentication: non
tamper-proof and tamper-proof. We denote the set of substations
with non tamper-proof authentication (e.g., substations
with a BITW device to authenticate the data sent to the control
(2) center, or an RTU with a non tamper-proof data authentication
module) by E N ⊆ S . For a route rsi we denote by σEN (rsi) the
set of substations in which the data are susceptible to attack
despite non tamper-proof authentication. Data authenticated
(3) in a non tamper-proof way is only susceptible to attack at
the substation where it originates from, if physical access
is possible. Therefore, for every route rsi ∈ Rs it holds that
σEN (rsi) = {s} if s ∈ E N and σEN (rsi) = rsi otherwise.
Similarly, we denote the set of substations with tamperproof
authentication (e.g., substations with a tamper-proof
RTU that authenticates the data sent to the control center)
by E P ⊆ S . Data authenticated in a tamper-proof way is not
susceptible to attack at any substation on the route, hence
σEP (rsi) = 0/ for every route rsi.
Finally, a substation can be protected against attacks, e.g.,
by guards, video surveillance or using tamper-proof system
components. We denote the set of protected substations by
P ⊆ S . Protected substations are not susceptible to attacks,
therefore σP (rsi) = rsi \ P . We assume that the substation where
(4) the control center is located is protected, that is, scc ∈ P .
Fig. 1 illustrates a simple power system and its communication
infrastructure. Some substations have applied mitigation
schemes, such as non tamper-proof authentication, tamperproof
authentication, and protection.

taken at substation s1 ∈/ E P ∪ E N is susceptible to attacks at substations s1, s2, and s3. A measurement taken at substation s6 ∈ E N is only susceptible to
attacks at substation s6 (σEN (rs16 ) = {s6}). A measurement taken at substation s4 ∈ E P is not susceptible to attacks (σEP (rs14 ) = 0/).
m. To perform the stealth attack, the attacker has to manipulate
measurement data from several measurements to avoid a BDD
alarm. To manipulate measurement data the attacker gets
access to the communication equipment located at a subset of
the substations. For example, the attacker could get physical
access to the equipment in an unmanned substation or could
remotely exploit the improper access configuration of the
communication equipment. By gaining access to a substation
s ∈ S (i.e., the switching equipment and the RTU) the attacker
can potentially manipulate the measurement data that are
measured in substation s and the data that are routed through
substation s, unless multi-path routing, data authentication or
protection make that impossible. To perform a stealth attack
on a particular measurement m (its value zm) the attacker
might need to attack several substations simultaneously, which
increases the cost of performing the attack.
In the following we propose two security metrics to characterize
the vulnerability of the system with respect to the
importance of individual substations and with respect to the
vulnerability of individual measurements. Both metrics depend
on the mitigation measures implemented by the operator. We
also propose an approximation for each metric based on the
communication graph topology.
A. Substation Attack Impact (Is)
We quantify the importance of substation s by its attack
impact Is, which is the number of measurements on which an
attacker can perform a stealth attack by getting access to a
single substation s.
By definition Is = 0 if the substation is protected (s ∈ P ).
Otherwise, we define Is as follows. A measurement m can be
attacked if and only if the susceptible parts of all routes from
S(m) to the control center pass through substation s. Let us
denote by Ms ⊂ {1, . . . , M} the index set of all such attackable
measurements. Then measurement m ∈ Ms can be stealthily
attacked if and only if the following system of equations has
a solution with respect to unknowns a ∈ RM and c ∈ Rn
a = Hc,
a(m ) = 0, ∀ m ∈/ Ms,
and a(m) = 1.
(5)
We note that due to the bilinearity of matrix multiplication,
the constraint on a(m) in (5) is equivalent to a(m) = 0. We
use a(m) = 1 for simplicity. The attack impact Is is then the
cardinality of the set of measurements for which (5) has a
solution. That is,
Is =
m ∃ a satisfying (5)
.
(6)
The attack impact of a substation depends on the routing
R , the set E N of substations with non tamper-proof authentication,
the set E P of substations with tamper-proof
authentication, and the set P of protected substations.
1) Calculating Is: By a linear algebra fact [21], a = Hc
for some c if and only if there exists a matrix Ns such that
Nsa = 0, where NsT is a basis matrix for the null space of
HT . Let us denote by Ns(:, Ms) the matrix formed by keeping
only the columns of Ns in Ms, a(Ms) as a vector formed by
keeping only the entries of a corresponding to Ms. Then (5)
is solvable if and only if
Ns(:, Ms)a(Ms) = 0,
and
viT a(Ms) = 1
(7)
1112
IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN COMMUNICATIONS, VOL. 30, NO. 6, JULY 2012
can be solved, where vi denotes the ith column of an identity
matrix of dimension |Ms|, and the ith entry of z(Ms) is z(m).
Next, let N˜ s be a basis matrix for the null space of Ns(:, Ms).
Then (7) is solvable if and only if there exists a vector c˜ s.t.
viT N˜ s c˜ = 1.
(8)
This is possible if and only if the ith row of N˜ s is not identically
zero. The above checking procedure applies to indices other
than i. Hence, the calculation of Is can be summarized as
Proposition 1.
Is =
i N˜s(i, :) = 0 .
The complexity of the calculation is dominated by the
singular value decomposition needed to find the basis matrix
NsT , and is O(M3).
2) Substation Betweenness I˜s: An intriguing question is
whether one can estimate Is based on the topology of the communication
graph G only, i.e., without considering the power
system. The substation betweenness I˜s, which we describe in
the following is inspired by the betweenness centrality of a
vertex in a graph [16]. The betweenness centrality of a vertex
corresponds to the importance of the vertex in the graph if all
nodes communicate with each other; it is often related to the
load the vertex is exposed to and to the dependence of the
network on the vertex.
To calculate the substation betweenness I˜s we assign to
every substation s as weight the number of measurements
taken at substation s (i.e., |{m : S(m) = s }|). For a given set of
established routes R the substation betweenness of substation
s is then given by the sum of the weights of the substations
s for which it holds that all their established routes to the
control center are susceptible to attack at substation s. This is
exactly the cardinality of the index set Ms used to define Is
˜
Is
=
|Ms|
(9)
The following proposition establishes the relationship between
the attack impact and the betweenness of a substation.
Proposition 2. The substation betweenness is an upper bound
for the attack impact, i.e., I˜s ≥ Is.
Proof: The result is trivial if substation s ∈ P , as I˜s = Is =
0. For s ∈ P observe that if a measurement m can be stealthily
attacked then by (5) and (6) it must be that m ∈ Ms.
Furthermore, if substation s is susceptible to attacks then I˜s
is no less than the number of measurements taken at substation
s, i.e., I˜s ≥ |{m : S(m) = s}|. The complexity of calculating
the substation betweenness is that of calculating Ms, which is
O(M), and is significantly lower than that of Is.
B. Measurement Attack Cost (Γm)
We quantify the vulnerability of measurement m by the
minimum number of substations that have to be attacked in
order to perform a stealth attack against the measurement, and
denote it by Γm. If the substation at which the measurement
is located is protected and uses non tamper-proof authentication
(S(m) ∈ P ∩ E N ), or it uses tamper-proof authentication
(S(m) ∈ E P) then the measurement is not vulnerable and we
define Γm = ∞.
Otherwise, for a measurement m we define Γm as the cardinality
of the smallest set of substations ω ⊆ S such that there
is a stealth attack against m involving some measurements m
at substations S(m ) such that every route of the substations
S(m ) involved in the stealth attack is susceptible to attack at
least in one substation in ω. That is,
Γm = ω⊆S m;ωiTnP =0/ |ω| s.t. ∃ a, c s.t. a = Hc, a(m) = 1 and
a(m ) = 0 =⇒ ω T σE (rSi(m )) = 0/,
∀ rSi(m ) ∈ RS(m ),
where σE (rSi(m )) denotes the substations in route rSi(m ) that
are susceptible to attack despite the authentication applied at
substation S(m ), i.e., σE (rSi(m )) = σEP (rSi(m )) T σEN (rSi(m )).
Similar to (5), the constraint on a(m) in (10) is equivalent to
a(m) = 0.
The attack cost of a measurement depends on the routing
R , the set E N of substations using non tamper-proof
authentication, the set E P of substations using tamper-proof
authentication, and the set P of protected substations. The
following proposition establishes a relationship between the
two security metrics; it states that if all measurements have
attack cost greater than 1 then all substations have attack
impact equal to 0. That is, there is no single substation that
would allow attacking a measurement in a stealthy way.
Proposition 3. Is = 0 ∀s ∈ S ⇐⇒ minm Γm > 1.
Proof: Follows directly from the definitions (6) and (10).
If ∃s Is > 0 then a stealth attack against any measurement
requires at least two substations to be attacked, Γm ≥ 2. If ∃s
Is > 0 then attacking substation s is sufficient to attack some
measurement m and hence Γm = 1.
1) Calculating Γm: We can obtain Γm by solving a mixed
integer linear programming problem (MILP) as follows. Define
decision vectors a ∈ RM and c ∈ Rn. a is the attack vector
to be determined. We need a to be a stealth attack targeting
measurement m and for the solution to be unique we require
the attack magnitude on m to be unit
(10)
a(m) = 1 and (4) is satisfied.
(11)
To describe the connection between the choice of which
substations to attack and the set of measurements that can be
attacked as a result of the substation attacks, two 0-1 binary
decision vectors are needed. One such binary decision vector
is x ∈ {0, 1}n+1, with x(s) = 1 if and only if substation s is
attacked. Hence, for protected substations (i.e., s ∈ P )
x(s) = 0
∀ s ∈ P .
The other binary decision vector is denoted as y ∈ {0, 1}M,
with y(m) = 1 meaning measurement m might be attacked
because of attacks on relevant substations. Conversely, y(m) =
0 means measurement m cannot be attacked. To apply y as an
indicator for which measurements can be attacked, we impose
a ≤ Ky and
− a ≤ Ky,
where the inequality is entry-wise and K is a scalar which is
regarded as “infinity”. A nontrivial upper bound for K can be
obtained from physical insight. Finally, measurement m can
be attacked if and only if the susceptible part of every route
(12)
(13)
VUCOVIC´ et al.: NETWORK-AWARE MITIGATION OF DATA INTEGRITY ATTACKS ON POWER SYSTEM STATE ESTIMATION
1113
between S(m ) and scc goes through at least one of the attacked
substations. This is captured by the following constraints
y(m ) ≤
∑
s∈σE (rSi(m ))
x(s),
∀ rSi(m ) ∈ RS(m ), ∀ m = 1, . . . , M
(14)
Note that by (14) itself it is possible to have y(m ) = 0
for some m , while the sum on the right-hand-side can be
greater than zero. However, this cannot happen at optimality
since the objective is to minimize the sum of all entries of x
(i.e., the number of substations to be attacked). The following
summarizes the calculation.
Proposition 4. The MILP for finding the attack scheme
on measurement m with the minimum number of substation
attacks is as follows:
minimize ∑ x(s)
a,c,x,y s∈S
subject to constraints (11) through (14)
x(s) ∈ {0, 1}
y(m ) ∈ {0, 1}
∀ s
∀ m .
(15)
If (15) is infeasible, then the measurement attack cost is
defined to be Γm = ∞. Otherwise, Γm is the optimal objective
function value in (15).
MILPs are NP-hard in general, but moderate instances of
(15) are feasible to solve offline using off-the-shelf MILP
solvers.
2) Measurement Connectivity Γ˜m: The measurement connectivity
Γ˜m is an approximation of the attack cost based on
the communication network topology. It is inspired by the
minimum vertex cut between two vertices of a graph, i.e.,
the smallest set of vertices within a graph whose removal
disconnects the two vertices.
We define the measurement connectivity of measurement m
as the cardinality of the minimum vertex cut for substation
S(m) and the control center scc. Intuitively, if an attacker
attacks the substations in the minimum vertex cut for substations
S(m) and scc then it can manipulate the value of
measurement m if the measurement data are susceptible to
attack at the substations specified in the minimum vertex cut.
This is the case if there is no data authentication at S(m) and
the substations are not protected. For measurements for which
S(m) = scc or S(m) is adjacent to scc we define Γ˜ m = ∞.
To calculate the measurement connectivity, we can use
Menger's theorem [17], which states that the cardinality of
the minimum vertex cut for two vertices equals the maximum
number of vertex-disjoint paths between the two vertices. The
maximum number of vertex-disjoint paths can be efficiently
calculated using Ford-Fulkerson-like algorithms. In particular,
because capacities are unit, Dinitz's algorithm finds the
maximum number of vertex-disjoint paths with complexity
O(min(|S |2/3, |E|1/2)|E|) [22].
The measurement connectivity Γ˜m is not an upper bound
for the attack cost Γm; it captures the minimum number of
substations that have to be attacked in order to tamper measurement
m given that substation S(m) is protected (S(m) ∈ P )
and given that the maximum number of node disjoint routes
is used.
V. MITIGATION MEASURES AGAINST ATTACKS
In the following we consider how an operator could improve
the security of the system by (i) changing the routes used by
the substations (ii) by using multipath routing (iii) and by
using data authentication and/or protection.
First, we formulate a result regarding mitigation schemes
that make stealth attacks impossible to perform, i.e., mitigation
schemes such that Γm = ∞, ∀m. For this to hold, the minimum
number of measurements zm needed to be protected is the
number of buses n [6], [14]. The straightforward way to protect
this many measurements is to deploy tamper-proof authentication
at all substations. The following result suggests that
one can mitigate stealth attacks by deploying authentication
in significantly less substations.
Proposition 5. Consider the power system graph, i.e., the
graph with vertex set S , and edges the transmission lines. If
Γm = ∞ ∀m then E P ∪ P is a dominating set of the power
system graph.
Proof: The dominating set of a graph is a subset of the
graph's vertices such that every vertex is either a member of
the subset or is adjacent to a vertex in the subset. To prove the
proposition, we show that if E P ∪ P is not a dominating set of
the power system graph then there is at least one measurement
m with Γm < ∞.
Since E P ∪ P is not a dominating set, there is at least
one substation s that is unprotected and not authenticated,
and is not adjacent to any substation s ∈ E P ∪ P . Take a
measurement m at a bus at substation s. This measurement
can be attacked by using an attack vector a = Hc for a vector
c whose only non-zero component is that corresponding to a
bus at substation s. a has nonzero components corresponding
to measurements at adjacent buses, and these measurements
are located at substations that do not use either authentication
or protection. Hence Γm < ∞. This concludes the proof.
The cardinality of the dominating set of connected graphs is
typically much smaller than the number of vertices, hence perfect
protection might be achievable without installing tamperproof
authentication at every substation. The numerical results
in Section VI validate this observation as do the results in [14],
[15]. Thus, Proposition 5 can be used to achieve perfect
protection with low computational complexity, as follows.
First, we find a dominating set of the power system graph.
Second, we deploy tamper-proof authentication at the substations
in the dominating set. Third, we use the CSF (Critical
Substation First) algorithm, described later in this section, to
select additional substations at which to deploy tamper-proof
authentication, one by one, until perfect protection is achieved.
Next, we turn to the problem of decreasing the vulnerability
of the system. A natural goal for the operator would be to
improve the most vulnerable part of the system, that is, to
minimize maxs∈S Is or to maximize minm∈M Γm, potentially
subject to some constraints on the feasible set of mitigation
measures (e.g., due to financial reasons). Maximizing the cost
of the least cost stealth attack can lead to increased average
attack cost as well, compared to maximizing the average attack
cost [14].
Instead of the above formulations, we formulate the operator's
goal as a multi-objective optimization problem. As
1114
IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN COMMUNICATIONS, VOL. 30, NO. 6, JULY 2012
we show later, the solution to this problem formulation is a
solution to the max-min formulation. We define the objective
γ to be the minimization of the number of measurements
with attack cost γ, |{m|Γm = γ}|. The objectives are ordered:
objective γ has priority over objective γ > γ. Formally, we
define the objective vector w ∈ NS−1 whose γth component
is wγ = |{m|Γm = γ}|. The goal of the operator can then be
expressed as
lexmin
R ,EN ,EP,P
w(R , E N , E P, P ),
(16)
where lexmin stands for lexicographical minimization [23],
w(R , E N , E P, P ) is the objective vector calculated using
Proposition 4 for the established routes R , the sets E N and
E P of authenticated substations, and the set P of protected
substations, and the optimization is performed over all feasible
mitigation schemes. The minimal objective vector w, wγ = 0
(1 ≤ γ ≤ S − 1) corresponds the case when no measurement
can be stealthily attacked, i.e., Γm = ∞ for all m ∈ M .
Proposition 6. The solution to (16) is a solution
to maxP ,EN ,EP,R minm∈M Γm. Furthermore, if
maxP ,E,R minm∈M Γm > 1 the solution to (16) is a solution
to minP ,EN ,EP,R maxs∈S Is.
Proof: We prove the first part of the proposition by contradiction.
Let w be the solution to (16), i.e., the lexicographically
minimal objective vector, and denote by γ∗ the smallest
attack cost for which wγ∗ > 0, i.e., γ∗ = min{γ|wγ > 0}.
Let γ = maxP ,EN ,EP,R minm∈M Γm be the max-min solution
and w a corresponding objective vector. Assume now that
γ∗ < γ . For γ < γ the objective vector has wγ = 0. Since
γ∗ < γ , wγ∗ = 0, and hence according to the definition of
lexicographical ordering w < w, which contradicts to the
assumption that w is lexicographically minimal.
The second part of the proposition follows directly from
Proposition 3 and from the first part of the proposition.
We solve the lexicographical minimization in (16) in an
iterative way [23]. Consider given R , E N , E P, P and let
γ∗ = min{γ|wγ > 0}. If γ∗ = ∞ the system is not vulnerable.
Otherwise, we use the critical substation first (CSF) algorithm
shown in Table I to decrease wγ for some γ ≥ γ∗ as long as
that is possible.
The algorithm starts by calculating the set Sˆ of critical substations.
In order to find the critical substations, the algorithm
identifies measurements with attack cost Γm = γ∗. Each such
measurement has at least one stealth attack ω with attack cost
||ω|| = γ∗. The substations that are contained in ω for every
such stealth attack are critical substations. There is at least one
such substation, the substation S(m). The critical substations
are the candidates for route reconfiguration, authentication or
protection.
For every critical substation sˆ the algorithm considers an
alternate mitigation scheme. The alternate mitigation scheme
could contain a new set of routes Rsˆ between substation sˆ
and the control center, or it could be the set of authenticated
or protected substations augmented by sˆ (E N (sˆ) = E N ∪ sˆ,
E P (sˆ) = E P ∪ sˆ or P (sˆ) = P ∪ sˆ). For every alternate mitigation
scheme the algorithm calculates the objective vector wsˆ
using Proposition 4, and selects the one with the minimal ob1.

VI. NUMERICAL RESULTS
In the following we show numerical results obtained using
the algorithms for two IEEE benchmark power systems: the
IEEE 118 and 300 bus power systems. Measurements are
assumed to be taken at every power injection and power flow.
We consider two communication network topologies. In the
first topology every substation communicates directly to the
control center, hence the communication network graph is a
star graph of order |S| + 1: the control center has degree |S| and
all substations have degree 1. We refer to this communication
network graph as the star topology. In the second topology
there is an edge between two substations s and s in the
communication network graph if there is a transmission line
between any two buses in substations s and s . The control
center is located adjacent to the substation with highest degree
scc. We refer to this communication network graph as the mesh
topology.
A. Baseline Numerical Results
We start with considering a baseline scenario. Authentication
is not used at any substation (E N = 0/, E P = 0/). For the
mesh topology we consider that all substations use a single
shortest path (|Rs| = 1) to the control center scc, and the
substation to which the control center is adjacent is protected
(P = {scc}). In the following we show the attack impact and
the measurement attack cost for the star and for the mesh
communication network topologies.
For the star topology, the substation betweenness of substation
s is equal to the number of measurements taken at
substation s, i.e., I˜s = |{m : S(m) = s}. Then by Proposition 2,
this is an upper bound for the attack impact.
For the mesh topology Fig. 2 shows the attack impact Is and
the substation betweenness I˜s for the substations for which
Is > 0 and I˜s > 0 for the two power systems. The results

show that there are several substations that would enable an
attacker to perform a stealth attack on a significant fraction
of the measurements in the power system, e.g., on about 1000
measurements for the 300 bus system (approx. 90% of all
measurements). Almost 50% of the substations have non-zero
attack impact, and the attack impact decreases slower than
exponentially with the rank of the substation. The substation
betweenness I˜s is very close to the attack impact for the
substations with the highest attack impacts (low ranks), but
it overestimates the attack impact significantly for substations
with low attack impact.
Table II shows the measurement attack costs for the star
and the mesh topologies, and the measurement connectivity
for the mesh topology. For the star topology and the 118 bus
power system there are no measurements with attack cost 1,
and most of the measurements (more than 90%) have an attack
cost of at least 3. Interestingly, for the 300 bus power system
the attack costs are significantly lower. Almost 20% of the
measurements have attack cost 1 and only around 45% of the
measurements have an attack cost of at least 3. The reason
is that in the 300 bus power system topology there are more
substations with several buses, and an attacker can tamper with
more measurements by accessing such substations.
The measurement attack costs for the mesh topology are
significantly lower than those for the star topology; e.g., for
the 118 bus power system more than 75% of the measurements
have attack cost 1 for the mesh topology, while none for the
star topology. The significant difference in terms of the attack
costs shows the importance of considering the communication
network topology when estimating the system security. We
also note that the measurement connectivity overestimates the
actual attack costs for the mesh topology. This is because the
attack costs were calculated for the case of a single shortest
path for every substation.

Motivated by the large substation attack impacts and low
measurement attack costs in the case of shortest path routing,
in the following we investigate how the operator can improve
the system security by changing single-path routes, using
multi-path routing, authentication and protection.
B. The Case of Single-path Routing
Modifying single-path routes has the smallest complexity
among the mitigation schemes we consider, hence we start
with evaluating its potential to decrease the vulnerability of
the system. For single-path routing the alternate mitigation
schemes differ only in terms of routing. Consequently, P (sˆ) =
P , E P (sˆ) = E P and E N (sˆ) = E N .
In the star topology, substations are directly connected to
the control center. Hence, modifying single-path routes is not
feasible. For the case of the mesh topology, in order to obtain
R (sˆ) from R for a critical substation sˆ we modify the only
route r1sˆ in Rsˆ. For a route r1sˆ we create the shortest alternate
route r1sˆ that avoids the substation s ∈ r1sˆ that appears in most
substation attacks ω with cardinality γ∗.
Fig. 3 shows the maximum normalized substation attack
impact, i.e., maxs Is/M, as a function of the number of singlepath
routes changed in the 118 bus system. The maximum
attack impact shows a very fast decay, and decreases by almost
a factor of two. At the same time the average path length to
the control center increases by only 10%.

increase the attack cost for about 200 measurements from
Γm = 1 to Γm = 2, and for some measurements to Γm = 3
(e.g., at iteration 5). Fig. 5 shows the corresponding results
for the 300 bus system. Note that after 27 iterations w1 does
not decrease, but instead w2 does. After 16 resp. 29 iterations
the algorithm could not find any single-path route that would
lead to increased attack cost for any measurement. Hence, we
turn to multi-path routing.

VII. CONCLUSION
We considered the problem of mitigating data integrity
attacks against the power system state estimator. By combining
a power flow model with a model of the SCADA communication
infrastructure, we developed a framework and proposed
security metrics to quantify the importance of substations
and the cost of stealthy attacks against measurements. We
provided efficient algorithms to calculate the security metrics.
We proposed easy to calculate approximations of the security
metrics based on the communication network topology only.
We proposed an algorithm to improve the system security by
using various mitigation measures, such as modified routing
and data authentication. We illustrated the potential of the
solutions through numerical examples on large IEEE benchmark
power systems. Our results show the importance of
considering the physical system and the network topology
jointly when analyzing the security of the state estimator
against attacks. It is subject of our future work to analyze
the robustness of our metrics to changes in the power system
topology and to random failures.
