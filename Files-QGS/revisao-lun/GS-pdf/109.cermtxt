Secure Networked Control Systems Against Replay Attacks Without
Injecting Authentication Noise
Bixiang Tang, Luis D. Alvergue, and Guoxiang Gu
Abstract- This paper studies detection of replay attacks on
networked control systems, assuming that the actuation and
sensing signals are transmitted over an additive white Gaussian
noise channel. It explores the use of the spectral estimation technique
to detect the presence of a replay attack without injecting
authentication noise to the control signal at the plant input. Our
proposed detection method is applicable to networked feedback
systems equipped with stable controllers and designed with
classical and modern control system techniques. A numerical
example from the literature is used to illustrate the detection
results for replay attacks on networked control systems.
I. INTRODUCTION
Networked control systems (NCSs) have received great
attention in the control system community. Such a feedback
system employs information technology (IT) to connect the
plant and controller, and allow communication through a
shared network. Hence, this configuration has a wide range of
applications, including mobile sensor networks [16], multiagent
systems [17], and automated highway systems [19],
among others. For a more thorough overview of the state
of the art see the special issues [1], [2], and the references
therein. However, NCSs suffer from a greater vulnerability
due to the presence of both cyber and physical attacks
[15]. For this reason security issues in NCSs have attracted
considerable interest [4], [6], [7], [22].
This paper addresses a particular attack, termed as replay
attack studied first in [14], one year before the Stuxnet worm
was exposed in the news media. Allegedly Stuxnet was
initially used to counter Iran's nuclear program [5], [11],
but it can be used by any malicious attacker who wishes
to disrupt any system that relies on feedback. So long as
attackers have remote access to sensing and actuation devices
and they are able to modify the software or reprogram the
devices, it is possible to launch coordinated attacks against
the system infrastructure (that is full of feedback control
systems) without being detected by the underlying NCS until
it is too late.
Replay attacks assume that the sensing data are secretly
recorded by the attacker, which are then replayed back to the
monitor center while conducting the attack on the physical
system. The deception created by replay is often seen in
movies and spy fiction. A solution proposed in [14] injects
a known independently identically distributed (i.i.d.) zeromean
Gaussian noise into the control signal at the plant input

that serves as the authentication signal. Assuming an LQG
control system, a 2 detector can then be used to detect the
presence of the replay attack. It is shown in [14] that when
the replay attack is present, the normalized error covariance
of the innovation signal of the Kalman filter deviates from
identity with a higher variance dependent on the variance of
the injected noise. As its variance increases, the detection
rate improves but the control performance suffers. There
exists a trade-off between the detection rate and loss of the
control performance in terms of the variance of the authentication
signal. A method is proposed in [8] for designing
the covariance of the authentication signal to minimize the
performance loss while guaranteeing a certain probability
of the detection rate. A different method is proposed in
[13] by switching the feedback controller between the LQG
(with no added noise) and the secure (with added noise)
controllers. Results from non-cooperative stochastic games
are used to minimize the worst-case control and detection
cost. Another method injects i.i.d. Gaussian noise to the
control signal on and off periodically [21], which can also
provide similar trade-off between the control performance
loss and the false detection rate. A natural question arises: Is
it possible to detect the presence of the replay attack without
injecting Gaussian noise? This problem becomes meaningful
for NCSs due to the information distortion induced by the
network channels, which may play a similar role to the
injected noise at the control input. This paper considers
a special type of NCSs involving additive white Gaussian
noise (AWGN) channels. Such channels are well-studied
in wireless communications [18], and in NCSs over fading
channels [3], [9]. However, the 2-detector does not seem to
work well due to the small bandwidth of the high loop gain.
A spectral estimation approach is thus proposed to estimate
the frequency response of the plant measurements at some
specific frequency at which the plant gain is high while the
controller gain is not small. It will be shown that the spectral
estimator at this frequency provides a viable detector for
replay attacks.
II. PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS
An NCS has the feedback controller situated in a different
physical location from that of the plant, and it communicates
with the plant via a (often wireless) network. The use
of networks in feedback control systems thus creates a
vulnerability for malicious attacks which seek to destabilize
and damage the physical system. Specifically, consider the
discrete-time feedback control system shown in Figure 1 in
which d(t) represents the disturbance input, (t) consists
of both measurement noise, 0(t), and communication error
c(t), where t is integer-valued. Mathematically (t) =
0(t) + c(t).

Fig. 1. Feedback control system
In Fig. 1, the reference or command input is assumed to
be zero or removed together with its steady-state response in
order to understand better the real issue in secure feedback
control. The closed-loop transfer matrix from the exogenous
inputs (fd(t)g; f (t)g) to the controller output and input
(fv(t)g; fw(t)g) signals is given by
TK (z) =

Without loss of generality the multi-input/multi-output
(MIMO) plant model P (z) with m-input/p-output is assumed
to admit a stabilizable and detectable state-space realization.
Its transfer matrix is described by
P (z) = D + C(zI

(1)
As a result, a stabilizing state feedback gain F and a
stabilizing state estimation gain L exist such that (A + BF )
and (A + LC) are both a Schur stability matrix. It is well
known that P (z) admits left/right coprime factorizations
(LCF/RCF) [10]
P (z) = M~ (z) 1N~ (z) = N (z)M (z) 1
with fM~ (z); N~ (z); M (z); N (z)g all stable transfer matrices.
Assume that the feedback system in Fig. 1 is internally
stable. Then the controller K(z) admits LCF/RCF given by
K(z) = V~ (z) 1U~ (z) = U (z)V (z) 1

satisfying the Bezout identity

It is emphasized that the LCF/RCF for the plant model
and for the stabilizing controller always exist and satisfy the
Bezout identity in (3). The computation of such LCF/RCF
for the plant and controller can be simplified for the observerbased
controller

of K(z) shown above are available, then
J (z) = U~0(z)V (z) V~0(z)U (z) = V~ (z)U0(z) U~ (z)V0(z):
Normally the exogenous inputs fd(t)g and f (t)g are
wide-sense stationary (WSS) random processes, and are
often white processes. However when attacks are present,
fd(t)g and f (t)g are replaced by f u(t) + d(t)g and
f y(t) + (t)g, respectively, as shown in Figure 2.

It is assumed that the signals available for monitoring are
at the controller site, and hence fv(t); w(t)g can be logged
by the controller, while the most valuable data fu(t); y(t)g
from the physical system are unavailable. In order to conceal
the attack and induce damages, it is very likely that f u(t)g
are unbounded, but f y(t)g are bounded. Even if a bounded
u(t) is used for the malicious attack, it can be very
irregular and disruptive in order to cause hardware damage
to the physical system. As a result, f u(t)g and f y(t)g
injected by the malicious attacker have different objectives:
the former is aimed at replacing u(t) so to damage the
physical system while the latter is aimed at concealing the
true output y(t).

This paper will be focused on the replay attack studied
initially in [14], [15]. The notorious Stuxnet worm is a prime
example of such an attack. It fits into the framework in Figure
2 by taking u(t) = 0 and

y(t) = (q
w(t) = y(t

) + o(t
) + c(t)
for t
t , where q 1 is the unit delay operator. Recall
(t) = 0(t) + c(t):
where both terms are i.i.d. random noise. From (8) it is
clear that the replay attack has the effect of substituting
the output (and measurement noise) at time t with the samples
delayed output. This way the attack conceals the
real-time output of the plant and it is probably the easiest
way to fake the output of a normally operating plant. With
>> 1, the catastrophic result of the true y(t) under attack
u(t) is not observed at the controller site until a very long
time later.
The replay attack results in
w(t) = P (q)[v(t
) + d(t
)] + o(t

absence of attacks:
). Contrast the above to the case in
w(t) = P (q)[v(t) + d(t)] + o(t) + c(t):
The replay attack is very effective so long as the controller
K(z) is stable and the feedback system is in steady-state, in
light of the fact that w(t) in absence of attacks is statistically
no different from that in presence of attacks. A significant
challenge posed by the replay attack lies in proposing a
method to detect the attack without injecting noise and that
is also applicable to commonly used control systems other
than LQG. This problem will be studied in the next section.
III. DETECTION OF REPLAY ATTACKS
Injection of authentication noise is effective to detect if
a replay attack is present. However the noise injected at
the plant input has to be large enough in order to achieve
good detection performance, which deteriorates the control
system performance. So there is a tradeoff between detection
performance and control performance as demonstrated in [8],
[13], [21]. In this paper the underlying NCS is assumed to
employ network communications between the plant output
and controller input over an AWGN channel, and thus
(t) present at the plant output has the form of (9). It
will be shown that the AWGN channel, while introducing
information distortion, can help detection of the replay attack
without injecting i.i.d. Gaussian noise at the plant input,
provided that the noise power due to the AWGN channel
is not too small. The following result provides two different
LCFs of the plant model which will be useful later. The
symbols 0 and stand for transpose and conjugate transpose,
respectively.
Lemma 1 Assume that the plant model P (z) in (1) admits a
stabilizable and detectable realization, and fd(t); (t)g are
both temporal white processes with covariance Qd and Q ,
respectively.
(i) Let Yn 0 be the stabilizing solution to the discrete-time
algebraic Riccati equation (DARE):
Yn = AYnA0
(AYnC0 + BQdD0)Zn 1(AYnC0 + BQdD0)0

where Zn = Q + DQdD0 + CYnC0. Then with L =
Ln := (AYnC0 + BQdD0)Zn 1, the left coprime factors
of P (z) in (4) are now given by P (z) = M~ n(z) 1N~n(z)

where Z0 = I + DD0 + CY0C0. Then with L = L0 :=
(AY0C0+BD0)Z0 1, the left coprime factors of P (z) in (4)

Consider first the LCF in Lemma 1 (i). It indicates that
under (i),
N (t) := N~n(q)d(t) + M~ n(q) (t)
is a white process with mean zero and covariance identity.
That is, the power spectral density (PSD) of N (t) is identity
at all frequencies. Let K(z) = Un(z)Vn(z) 1 be an RCF for
some stable and proper Vn(z) and Un(z) by taking V (z) =
Vn(z) and U (z) = Un(z) in (2). Note that K(z) may not
be an observer-based controller. In fact it can be PID or
lead/lag compensator, provided that it stabilizes the feedback
system in Figure 1 or 2. Now choosing L = Ln implies
N~ (z) = N~n(z), and M~ (z) = M~ n(z) for the LCF of P (z)
in (4). Since K(z) is stabilizing, Vn(z) and Un(z) can be
chosen such that
Vn(z) = Vo(z) + N (z)J (z);
Un(z) = Uo(z)
M (z)J (z);
for some stable J (z) in light of (6) by simply setting V (z) =
Vn(z) and U (z) = Un(z). In addition there holds
M~ n(z)Vn(z) + N~n(z)Un(z) = I 8 jzj

The right coprime factorization of P (z) = N (z)M (z) 1 can
be obtained by taking some stabilizing state feedback gain

F , and thus Vo(z); Uo(z), and V~o(z); U~o(z) are also available
by using L = Ln and the chosen stabilizing state feedback
gain F .
Consider first the case of no attack. Using the coprime
factorization description of the plant and controller, and (14),
it can be shown that
TK (z) =
Un(z)
Vn(z)
N~n(z)
M~ n(z) :
(15)
Stability of K(z) implies that Vn(z) 1 is also a stable and
causal transfer matrix. It follows that w(t) = Vn(q)N (t)
by (15) and the definition of N (t) in (13). Thus Vn(z) 1
represents a whitening filter in the sense that the filtered
signal
s(t) = Vn(q) 1w(t) = N (t)
(16)
is a white process with covariance identity, in light of
the normalized left coprime factorization in (11) and the
discussion after Lemma 1. Consequently the PSD of s(t)
is given by s(!) = I for all !. Suppose that the replay
attack takes place at t = t for the duration of >> 1.
The PSD, w(!), for w(t) is given in the following result.
Theorem 1 Suppose that o(t) and c(t) are independent
white processes for all t. Let fM~ n(z); N~n(z)g in (10) be
LCF of P (z) satisfying (11), and fVn(z); Un(z)g be RCF of
the stabilizing controller satisfying (14). Under the replay
attack, the PSD of w(t) is given by
w(!) = Vn(ej!) hI
M~ n(ej!)Q c M~ n(ej!) i Vn(ej!)
+ N (ej!)U~ (ej!)Q c U~ (ej!) N (ej!) + Q c
where Q c is the covariance of c(t). In this case the PSD
of s(t) in (16) is given by
s(!) = I
M~ n(ej!)Q c M~ n(ej!)
+ Vn(ej!) 1 hN (ej!)U~ (ej!)Q c U~ (ej!) N (ej!)

Proof: Suppose that t > t . Denote

),
w(t) = w (t) = y(t

By the relation w(t) = Vn(q)N (t), there holds

The Bezout identity in (3) can now be written as

The above implies I

Vn(z)M~ n(z) = N (z)U~ (z), leading to
) + M~ n(q) o(t )i
N (q)U~ (q) c(t
) + c(t): (19)
The expression of w (t) is different from w(t) prior to t .
As a result s(t) = Vn(q) 1w (t) is not a white process in
general. Since the four terms in (19) are all uncorrelated, the
PSD of w(t) over [t ; t + ) can be easily obtained as in
the proposition in which the normalization property (11) is
used in obtaining the PSD expression. The PSD of s(t) in
(17) follows by s(t) = Vn(q) 1w(t). 2
The above result shows that if k s(!) Ik is significantly
greater than zero in most of the frequency range, then
successful detection of the presence of replay attacks has a
high probability. As a result, detection of the replay attack is
equivalent to detecting whether or not s(t) is white. However
the hypothesis on large deviation for k s(!) Ik in most of
the frequency range does not hold in engineering practice.
For this reason, it is more meaningful to consider the PSD of
w(t) or s(t) at some specific frequency for which the LCF in
(ii) of Lemma 1 plays an important role. It is also important
to point out that the LCF in (ii) of Lemma 1 does not make
use of the covariance of the input disturbance or/and output
noise, and is thus more advantageous and admits robustness
against the inaccuracy of the covariance matrices Qd and
Q .
Now consider the LCF in (ii) of Lemma 1, and RCF
P (z) = N (z)M (z) 1 based on some stabilizing state
feedback gain F . Let K(z) = U (z)V (z) 1 be a given
stabilizing controller. Then in light of the parameterization
of the stabilizing controllers in (5) and (6),
V (z) = Vo(z) + N (z)J (z);
U (z) = Uo(z)
M (z)J (z)
for some stable and proper J (z) where Ko(z) =
Uo(z)Vo(z) 1 is an observer-based controller using the state
feedback gain F and state estimation gain L0. It follows from
P (z) = M~ 0(z) 1N~0(z) that TK (z) in (15) can be written
as
TK (z) =
U (z)
V (z)
N~0(z)
M~ 0(z) :
The next result provides the expression of the PSD of w(t)
at high-gain frequency !h with P (ej!) ! 1 as ! ! !h.
Theorem 2 Suppose that the input noise d(t) is a white
process with covariance Qd = d2Im, and the AWGN noise
have covariance Q c = 2c Ip. Assume that p m, and
i[P (ej!)] has infinity gain at ! = !h for 1 i p
where i( ) is the ith singular value arranged in descending
order. Let w(!), and s(!) be the PSD for w(t), and s(t),
respectively. In the absence of replay attacks,

Remark 1 Consider the single-input/single-output (SISO)
case. The normalized coprime factors in (ii) of Lemma 1
implies that jN~0(ej!h )j = 1 by M~ 0(ej!h ) = 0 due to the
assumption of jP (ej!h )j = 1. In addition M (ej!h ) = 0.
Thus U (ej!h )N~0(ej!h ) = 1. It follows that jU (ej!h )j = 1
as well, and hence jV (ej!h )j has a small value, provided
that K(z) = U (z)V (z) 1 has a reasonably large gain at
!h, which is ensured by several different design techniques,
including the classical Bode design method and H1 loop
shaping [12]. Often !h = 0 and in this case if jV (ej!h )j is
not very small, a lag type compensator can be added in by
replacing K(z) by
K(z) +
z
1 +
with both > 0 and > 0 much smaller than 1 and >> 1.
Hence the gain of V (z) 1 can be boosted to help increase
the detection rate without sacrificing the false alarm rate.
The addition of the lag type compensator z 1+ helps to
improve the steady-state performance while compromising
little of the transient response. See our numerical example
in Section IV. 2
Theorem 2 and Remark 1 show that

where H0 represents the hypothesis for the absence, and H1
for the presence of the replay attack. The two terms on the

IV. AN ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE
An example from [14] is employed to illustrate our proposed
detection technique. This example considers a room
temperature control system. Let T (t) be the room temperature
at time index t and T be the desired temperature.
Denote x(t) = T (t) T as the state variable. Then the
following describes the dynamic process of the temperature
deviation:
x(t + 1) = x(t) + u(t) + d(t);
y(t) = x(t) + (t):
It is assumed in [14] that the disturbance d(t) and measurement
noise o(t) are i.i.d. Gaussian processes with variance
1 and 0.1 respectively. This paper assumes that c(t), the
AWGN of the communication channel at the plant output,
is also i.i.d. Gaussian. Clearly the plant model satisfies the
hypothesis of Theorem 2 by taking !h = 0 at which the plant
has an infinity gain. In contrast to the LQG controller in [14],
a simple deadbeat controller K(z) 1 is taken that places
the closed-loop pole to the origin. Since this controller does
not admit small gain for jV (ej!h )j at !h = 0, the deadbeat
controller is replaced by
0:09 z 0:9
K(z) = 1 + = ;
z 0:99 z 0:99
that is a lag compensator, following Remark 1. Hence the
value of jV (ej!h )j 1 is boosted 10 times. We employ
the detector in (24) with false alarm rate = 5%. The
detection performance is shown in Figure 3 based on an
average of 10,000 ensembles with the window size 5 for
spectrum estimation. The solid (blue), dotted (black), and
dashed line (red) curves show the detection rates when
2c = 0:1; 0:2; 0:6, respectively. The performance curves are
much better than those of [14] in which the detection rate
is only 0.35 when the noise injected to the control signal at
the plant input has variance 0.6. Intuitively speaking, the
authentication noise injected at the plant input is not as
effective as the communication noise present at the plant
output, considering that the noise at the plant input has to

The solid (red), dashed (blue), and dotted (black) lines
correspond to window size of 5, 10, and 20, respectively. It
is seen that as window size increases, the detection performance
improves. This observation is important, because the
variance of the communication noise cannot be chosen by the
designer. So if the variance is too small, the window size can
be increased in order to improve the detection performance.
However as the window size increases, the timely detection
of the replay attack can be a problem. It is clear then,
that there is a tradeoff between the window size and timely
detection. More details on the computational aspects involved
in computing V (z) in Theorem 2 and on spectrum estimation
can be found in [20].

V. CONCLUSION
This paper considers the problem of the replay attack on
NCSs. While this problem has been studied in a number of
papers, authentication noise has to be injected to the control
signal which degrades the control system performance. In
contrast, we propose to utilize the communication noise
that already exists in NCSs for detecting the replay attack.
Although the communication noise is unknown at each time
sample, it can also serve as a time stamp, in a similar manner
as the authentication noise. A spectral estimation method is
developed to estimate the spectrum of the received signal
at the controller site at a specific frequency. Its value or its
filtered value differ between the presence and absence of the
replay attack. A numerical example has been worked out to
illustrate our proposed detection algorithm.
