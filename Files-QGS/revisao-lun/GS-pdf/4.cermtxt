In today's Smart Grid, the power Distribution System Operator (DSO) uses real-time
measurement data from the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) for efficient,
accurate and advanced monitoring and control. Smart Grids are vulnerable to sophisticated
data integrity attacks like the False Data Injection (FDI) attack on the AMI sensors
that produce misleading operational decision of the power system (Liu et al., 2011 [1]).
Presently, there is a lack of research in the area of power system analysis that relates the
FDI attacks with system stability that is important for both analysis of the effect of cyberattack
and for taking preventive measures of protection.
In this paper, we study the physical characteristics of the power system, and draw a
relationship between the system stability indices and the FDI attacks. We identify the
level of vulnerabilities of each AMI node in terms of different degrees of FDI attacks. In
order to obtain the interdependent relationship of different nodes, we implement an
improved Constriction Factor Particle Swarm Optimization (CF-PSO) based hybrid clustering
technique to group the nodes into the most, the moderate and the least vulnerable
clusters. With extensive experiments and analysis using two benchmark test systems, we
show that the nodes in the most vulnerable cluster exhibit higher likelihood of destabilizing
system operation compared to other nodes. Complementing research is the
construction of FDI attacks and their countermeasures, this paper focuses on the understanding
of characteristics and practical effect of FDI attacks on the operation of the Smart
Grid by analysing the interdependent nature of its physical properties.

1. Introduction
In recent years, several cyber related attacks, including
the sophisticated Stuxnet worm attack [2], have highlighted
the importance of security research in the area of Smart Grid
infrastructure. It has been shown that a cyber-attack on the
Smart Grid can cause devastating impact on our daily life
resulting in cascading failures of critical Smart Grid infrastructure
and disruption in economy. Sophisticated new

attacks have emerged, targeting the increased use of intelligent
devices (such as Smart Meters) in today's Advanced
Metering Infrastructure (AMI) of the Smart Grid. There are
different of kinds of attacks on the Smart Grid, including
attacks on data availability, data confidentiality and data
integrity. An example of data integrity attack is where a vital
component of Smart Grid operational module can be affected
by injecting false data into the AMI. Recently, these types of
attacks, typically known as False Data Injection (FDI) attacks
[3], have drawn significant attention as they can bypass the
current security measures and exploit the system operations
such as the state estimation process.

State estimator, which is widely used at the utility
control centres to calculate the system status during the
power system operation, can also be used to filter out the
measurement errors and noises [4]. Generally, 'state estimator'
can be defined as a computer program which
calculates the system states based on the measured data
(at different nodes of the Smart Grid) and the equivalent
modelled data (based on Kirchhoff's current and voltage
laws of physical energy grid). In addition, the Bad Data
Detection (BDD) module of the state estimator suppresses
any bad data (if exists) based on the residual analysis.
Generally, the traditional SE module works based on the
principle of Weighted Least Squared (WLS) error minimization
method where attack or noise is detected based on
the residual analysis [4]. Liu et al. show that the Smart Grid
state estimators are now highly vulnerable to the cyber
attacks [3]. In the first work of these types of FDI attacks,
Liu et al. show that the attack cannot be detected by the
residual analysis if certain strategies are followed. Till then,
significant research works have been carried out from both
attacker's and defender's point of view, discussed below.
Authors in [1] develop some heuristic approaches to
exploit the DC state estimation considering both random
attacks and targeted attacks. Ozay et al. further extend the
work by considering distributed models to generate and
detect sparse attack in the state estimation process of the
Smart Grid [5]. Different threats of Advance Metering Infrastructure
(AMI) are also explored in the literature [6].
Defense strategies of the state estimation module and AMI
devices are also well studied [7-10]. For example, a defense
strategy based on graphical models to protect Smart Grid
against FDI attack is proposed in [7]. In that work, authors
consider a dc approximate model of the Smart Grid. Another
dc approximate model based protection and detection
mechanism is proposed by Yang et al. [8]. Typically, Smart
Grid has non-linear power flow characteristics and an ac
model of power flow equations can ensure more accurate
results. Analysing and comparing with ac model, Hug et al. in
[9] show that FDI attacks based on a dc model are more
prone to introduce errors in the measurement devices
resulting higher probability of detection through BDD technique.
To protect AMI, an intrusion Detection framework
based on consumption pattern of the end-users is proposed
in [10]. Although significant number of research works have
been conducted on simulating the FDI attacks [1,5,6] and
determining the countermeasures [7-10], there are significant
scopes to understand the security vulnerabilities of
Smart Grid against FDI based cyber attacks by analysing
the physical behaviours of the Smart Grid. Moreover, most of
the existing FDI attack simulation and defense strategies are
based on the transmission system [3,1,5,7-9] and there is a
lack of research works considering power distribution systems.
Traditionally, power distribution system has district
characteristics from transmission system, e.g., high Resistance
to Reactance Ratio, radial network, etc. Therefore, it is
important to conduct the vulnerability analysis considering
benchmark power distribution systems.
In this work, we have studied the interdependent nature
of nodes in a power grid and identified the vulnerable nodes
that are most sensitive to False Data Injection (FDI) attacks.
We have found that if the attacker specifically targets these
highly vulnerable nodes, then the attack will cause much
larger impact destabilizing the operation of the power grid
than any random selection of nodes. For example, if the same
attack vector is introduced as an FDI attack at different
measurement nodes, the power system operational states
(e.g., Voltage Magnitude and Angle) will vary differently
based on the physical properties of the individual nodes.
The most vulnerable node identified in our analysis has the
largest changes of the operational states and the opposite
characteristics are observed for the least vulnerable node.
This research is important from both attacker's and system
operator's (defender) point of view. Based on the understanding
of the node characteristics of the physical Smart
Grid, the attacker can decide which node to attack to ensure
significant changes of the operational states. On the other
hand, the system operator (act as a defender) can emphasis
on the real-time monitoring of the vulnerable nodes and
introduce proper security measures (e.g., real-time Intrusion
Prevention and Detection systems) on those locations.
Besides, a distribution system state estimation in a Smart
Grid, which has different characteristics from the widely
used transmission system state estimation, makes use of AMI
measurements instead of pseudo-measurements to enhance
the state estimation performance [11]. These AMI measurements
are deployed at the end-user nodes. The output of the
Smart Grid state estimation will be corrupted if an attacker
injects False Data in those AMI measurement devices. In this
work, we also conduct vulnerability analysis at different AMI
measurement nodes with different degrees of FDI attacks.
Specifically, the contributions of this paper are as
follows:
(1) In contrast to existing work on FDI attacks that lack
comprehensive power system analysis of the effect of the
FDI, in this paper we provide a theoretical study of the
relationship between FDI attack vectors and their effect
on nodal and system stability (Section 2.3). We show that
the Voltage Stability Index (VSI) [12], which is widely
used by Power System engineers to determine the
system stability [13,14], can also be used to understand
the likelihood of system stability under different degrees
of FDI based cyber attacks. To the best of our knowledge,
this paper, for the first time, considers the voltage
stability based indices to understand the cyber-physical
vulnerabilities under any information integrity attack (e.
g., FDI attacks) of a smart power distribution system.
(2) In order to properly identify nodes with similar levels
of vulnerabilities in a complex system, we propose and
implement a hybrid clustering algorithm based on the
traditional well studied k-means algorithm and the
Constriction Factor Particle Swarm Optimization (CFPSO)
to enhance the clustering performance. Experiments
performed using test data from UCI repository
of machine learning databases show that the CF-PSO
based improved clustering outperforms the traditional
k-means algorithm and the CF-PSO based clustering.
This improved clustering algorithm is then employed
to identify nodes that behave similarly based on their
physical properties in response to an FDI attack.

(3) Using the developed stability relationship model and
the improved clustering technique, we show that there
are certain clusters of nodes in a Smart Grid Distribution
System that are more susceptible, e.g., becomes
highly unstable, to FDI attacks compared to other
nodes in the grid. For example, the average change of
nodal voltage magnitude of the most vulnerable cluster
is around 506 kV and the least vulnerable cluster
experiences around 253 kV, when an equal FDI attack
vector is added with the original measurements.
The organization of this paper is as follows: In Section 2,
the definitions of VSI and FDI attacks and their relationship
are discussed. CF-PSO based Improved Clustering Technique
is proposed and evaluated in Section 3. The results and
discussions of AMI node vulnerabilities due FDI attacks,
considering benchmark test systems, are presented in
Section 4. A brief discussion on the protection of the
vulnerable nodes against cyber intrusions is presented in
Section 5. The paper concludes with some brief remarks in
Section 6.
2. Discussion on FDI attacks and voltage stability indices
2.1. Voltage Stability Index (VSI)
Power distribution system has distinct characteristics
compared with transmission system, e.g., high Resistance/
Reactance ration, radial nature, low voltage and high current
level, more power loss compared with transmission systems,
etc. [15]. In a power distribution system, voltage stability is a
major issue [16].
Generally, substation operates at a higher voltage and the
node voltage decreases gradually throughout the distribution
feeder. Distribution System Operator (DSO) needs to maintain
the voltage profile of each node of the system within a
stability margin. Under critical loading condition or any
physical disturbance, distribution system may face voltage
collapse. In practice, the voltage drops gradually with the
increase of the loading and after a certain limit, there is a
sharp decrease of the voltage magnitude which changes the
frequency and makes the system unstable for operation.
Significant research works have been conducted for
voltage stability analysis for both transmission and distribution
systems [17]. In this work, we consider a well established
voltage stability index proposed by Chakravorty et al.
as follows [12]:
4
VSIÃ°NrÃ Â¼ Vs
4Ã°PrX
Q rRÃ2
4Ã°PrR Ã¾ Q rXÃV s2
Ã°1Ã
where VSIÃ°N2Ã is the voltage stability index at the receiving
end of (Nr) a branch. Vs is the voltage magnitude at the
sending end (Ns), R and X are the resistance and reactance of
that branch respectively. Pr is the summation of the real
power loads of all downstream nodes from the node 'r', the
real power load at node 'r' and the real power losses of all
downstream branches from the node 'r'. Similarly, Qr is the
summation of the reactive power loads of all downstream
nodes from the node 'r', the reactive power load at node 'r'
and the reactive power losses of all downstream branches
from the node 'r'.
Power flow study, which is basically based on Kirchhoff's
current and voltage laws of the physical system, provides the
system states, including Vs, Pr and Qr. Other parameters of
Eq. (1), R and X, can be obtained from the power network
electric topological database. After a successful power flow
solution of system, all parameters of Eq. (1) are known from
which the VSI index of each node can be calculated.
For a stable operation of the system, i.e., the voltage
magnitude larger than the voltage collapse point, the
VSIÃ°NrÃ Z 0. The node with the minimum VSI indicates that
it is more prone to voltage collapse compared with other
nodes of that system [12].
2.2. FDI attacks on the Smart Grid state estimation
For safe and reliable operation of the power distribution
system, operators need to monitor and control the system as it
progresses through its various operating states. To reduce
measurement errors, state estimation is widely used by power
system operators to calculate theoretical values of the system
parameters (e.g., Voltage, Current, and Power) and compare
against the measurement data. [4]. However, a traditional
power distribution system has very limited number of measurement
devices, consequently, pseudo-measurements are
made instead [18]. Pseudo-measurements are derived from
the forecasted consumer demand data which is calculated
based on the historical consumption profile of the end users.
As forecasted data comes with forecast error and errors due to
change in end user behaviour [19], the pseudo-measurements
are unreliable for accurate state estimation of a traditional
power system. Fortunately, in a Smart Grid context, the realtime
AMI measurements can significantly improve the state
estimation accuracy by incorporating the actual readings from
the Smart Meters [11]. However, FDI attacks through AMI
devices may bypass the Bad Data Detection (BDD) module of
the state estimator using sophisticated attack strategies [1],
discussed below.
2.2.1. FDI attack on DC state estimation
Consider a measurement vector z for a n-bus systems
with m AMI measurements. The measurement vector z
contains measurement noises (which is assumed white
Gaussian noise as represented by e), therefore, z can be
written as follows:
z Â¼ Hx Ã¾ e
here, H is the calculated function values for the state
variables x, typically known as system Jacobian [1]. Now,
the state estimation can be formulated as a Weighted Least
Square (WLS) error minimization problem as follows:
min
J z
Hx J
Under normal operating condition, the measurement data
and the equivalent modelled data of those measurement
outputs are very close, hence, the error obtained from the
state estimation module is very close to zero and lies within
the threshold value. In this situation, J z Hx J o Ï, the Bad
Data Detection module of the state estimation detects no
Alarms. If an attacker can gain access to the measurement
devices including AMI sensors, an attack vector 'a' can be
manipulated with the measurement signals such that the
Ã°2Ã
Ã°3Ã
state estimator (shown in Eq. (4)) will cross the threshold
and attack will be detected) [9]. Note that the attacker can
only access to the measurement devices but not the
system states. Therefore, the attacker will manipulate only
the measurements which are directly related to those
system states to keep it undetectable [9]. Relation of the
measurements and the system states can be found from
the Jacobian matrix, Jh as shown in Eq. (6).To this end, the
AC state estimation process under the FDI attack can be
written as [9]
J z0 hÃ°x0Ã J
Â¼ J z Ã¾ a hÃ°x Ã¾ cÃ J
Â¼

!
hÃ°xnÃ
hÃ°xn; xa Ã¾ cÃ

204
A. Anwar et al. / Information Systems 53 (2015) 201-212
corrupted state becomes x0 Â¼ x Ã¾ c and the new corrupted
measurement is z0 Â¼ z Ã¾ a. To keep the attack undetectable,
the attacker can choose the attack vector in such a way that
aÂ¼ Hc where c is a vector of non-zero values with the same
length of H, as suggested by Liu et al. [3,1]. Therefore, for the
new corrupted states x0, the manipulated norm of the
residual will be
J z0 Hx0 J Â¼ J z Ã¾ a
HÃ°x Ã¾ cÃ J Ã°here; x0 Â¼ x Ã¾ c and z0 Â¼ z Ã¾ aÃ
Â¼ J z Ã¾ a
Â¼ J z Hx J
Hx
Hc J
Ã°as; a Â¼ HcÃ
From the above expression, the residual from the
corrupted measurements produces the same residual as
calculated by the normal system operation. Hence,
J z0 Hx0 J will pass the BDD test as J z Hx J o Ï, and the
FDI attack remains undetectable.
2.2.2. FDI attack on AC state estimation
In the previous section, we discussed the stealthy FDI
attacks on the DC state estimation. Here, a discussion on
how the state estimation module of the AC system can also be
compromised considering the FDI attacks is presented.
In the state estimator of AC systems, the measured
power flows are a nonlinear function of system states (e.g.,
voltage magnitudes and angles). Hence, the AC state
estimation can be modelled using the following nonlinear
expressions:
min J z hÃ°xÃ J Ã°4Ã
where z is the measurement vector that can be written as
follows:
2 z1 3 2 h1Ã°x1; x2; â¥; x3Ã 3 2 e1 3
66 â® 77 66 â® 77 66 â® 77

hnÃ°x1; x2; â¥; x3Ã
Ã°5Ã
here, e is the vector of measurement noise, x is the vector
of system states (generally, voltage magnitudes and
angles), h(x) is the Jacobian matrix which is also represented
as Jh. It shows the non-linear relation of the
measurements and the system states, as shown below:

Upon gaining the access of a specific measurement device,
the attacker can launch a FDI attack which alters the value
of measurement data. In order to keep the attacked
measurement hidden, at least one state variable needs to
be influenced (otherwise, error value obtained from the
where z Â¼ zn Ã¾ za and hÃ°xÃ Â¼ hÃ°xnÃ Ã¾ hÃ°xn; xa Ã¾ cÃ, considering
that the terms with subscript 'n' are normal measurements

keep the FDI attack undetectable, J z0 hÃ°x0Ã J Â¼ J z hÃ°xÃ J
(as, in normal condition J z hÃ°xÃ J o Ï). Therefore,

solving Eqs. (7) and (8), the value of attack vector, a, can be
obtained as follows [9]:
a Â¼ hÃ°xn; xa Ã¾ cÃ hÃ°xn; xaÃ Ã°9Ã
From Eq. (9), to launch an attack vector a, the attacker
needs to know the relevant system state values. More
information on how the attacker can initiate the undetectable
FDI attacks on the state estimation module of an
AC system can be obtained from [9].
The observation of Liu et al. [3,1] for DC state estimation
and the observation of Hug et al. [9] for AC state
estimation can also be applied in the context of AMI based
Smart Grids, if we consider the AMI measurements are a
subset of the total measurements as shown in Eq. (5). If an
attacker gains access to all or a subset of the AMI devices,
say, l-AMI devices, he/she can generate an FDI attack by
choosing a nonzero attack vector a Â¼ fa1; â¦; amg in such a
way that the attack vectors at the non-accessible devices
become zero (so, ai Â¼ 0, where, i a fAMI devicesg). More
insights on how undetectable attacks can be generated
and their possible countermeasures are studied in recent
works [20,3,1,5,7-9]. It is important to mention that the
FDI attacks (where the objective of the attack is to disrupt
the system operation) through the AMI devices have two
major consequences.
(1) If the FDI attack remains undetectable (e.g., residuals are
less than a threshold in the traditional Weighted Least Square
based estimator), the system states (e.g., voltage magnitude,
angle) obtained from the state estimation process will provide
wrong information [4]. Real-time or extended real-time
operation of the system, e.g., Optimal Power Flow (OPF)
205
Ã°16Ã
Ã°17Ã
solution or Volt-VAr Control (VVC), will produce misleading
operational decisions based on the wrong system states
obtained from the state estimation process. This misleading
operational decision will degrade the system performance and
stability, which may even lead to a large-scale blackout or
cascading failure.
(2) In those cases where the FDI attack becomes detectable
through the residual test, or using other Intrusion
Detection Systems, it is still difficult to perform state
estimation based on the limited measurements which are
not corrupted. Therefore, the system states are unobservable
for a portion of the network where the measurements
are corrupted [9]. Hence, it is not possible to take operational
decisions based on the limited knowledge of the
whole system.
Consequently, FDI attacks, whether detected or undetected,
will have direct impact on the operation of the Smart
Grid. As the scope of this paper is to investigate the effect of
FDI attacks on system stability under different degrees of
FDI attacks, in the next section, we will show how the
relationship of the VSI index and FDI is correlated.
2.3. Relationship of the VSI index and FDI attack vectors
Generally, for real-time or extended real-time operation
of SPDS, the electricity distribution operator collects power
consumption data from the AMI devices through a SCADA
network. If an attacker gains access to any or all of the AMI
devices, he/she can manipulate the power consumption
data by injecting false information. Let us consider the lAMI
devices are under FDI attacks, therefore, the corrupted
real and reactive power measurements, PiFDI and Q iFDI, will
be as follows:
PiFDI Â¼ Pi0 Ã¾ ai; i 8 f1; 2; â¦; lg
Q iFDI Â¼ Q i0 Ã¾ ai; i 8 f1; 2; â¦; lg
where Pi0 and Q i0 are the actual measured real and reactive
powers of i-th AMI devices respectively. ai represents the
corresponding attack vectors. Now, considering ai Â¼ Pi0Î²i,
where Î² is a multiplication factor of actual measurements,
Eq. (10) can be written as
PiFDI Â¼ Pi0 Ã¾ Pi0Î²i
Â¼ Pi0Ã°1 Ã¾ Î²iÃ
Similarly,
Q iFDI Â¼ Q i0Î»i
Â¼ Pi0Î»i Ã°consider; 1 Ã¾ Î²i Â¼ Î»iÃ
In Eqs. (12) and (13), we define Î» as the degree of attack
which can be any real number.
Now, recall that the VSI of any node of the Smart Grid is
defined using Eq. (1). From the definition of VSI, real and
reactive power at the r-th node can be written under the
normal operational condition as follows:
Pr Â¼ â PL0 Ã¾ PLÃ°rÃ Ã¾ i â8dPLoss
0
i 8 c
Q r Â¼ â Q L0 Ã¾ Q L0Ã°rÃ Ã¾ i â8dQ Loss
i 8 c
A. Anwar et al. / Information Systems 53 (2015) 201-212
Ã°10Ã
Ã°11Ã
Ã°12Ã
Ã°13Ã
Ã°14Ã
Ã°15Ã
where PL0 and QL0 are the real and reactive power loads of the
energy users, respectively. PLÃ°rÃ and Q LÃ°rÃ are the real and
reactive power loads of the r-th energy users, respectively.
PLoss and QLoss are the real and reactive power losses of the
branches, respectively. Here, c and d represent all bus and
branches respectively, beyond the node 'r' where VSI is
being calculated.
If 'r' is an AMI measurement node, under an attack
scenario Eqs. (14) and (15) can be modified using Eqs. (12)
and (13) as follows:
Pr Â¼ â PL0 Ã¾ PLÃ°rÃÎ»r Ã¾ â PLoss
0
i 8 c i 8 d
Q r Â¼ â Q L0 Ã¾ Q L0Ã°rÃÎ»r Ã¾ â Q Loss
i 8 c i 8 d
Now, depending on the value of Î»r, Pr and Qr will change,
which will impact on the VSI index as defined in Eq. (1). From
Eqs. (16) and (17), any injection of false information will
increase the value of Pr and Qr, which will again decrease
the value of VSI observed from Eq. (1), as distribution side of
the power system has high R/X ratio [21]. Any lower value of
the VSI indicates that the system is highly likely to voltage
collapse. So, the operators should become concerned about
keeping the system within stability margin. From Eq. (1), we
see that the VSI depends not only the operational value of Pr
and Qr but also other physical properties of the power grid,
which are R and X. Therefore, for the same value of Î» (which
indicates a same amount of false data injection) at different
nodes, the corresponding VSI will vary depending on the
values of R and X of the downstream branches of the node
being attacked.
In this section, the relationship of VSI and FDI attack is
discussed. In Section 4, we show the impact of FDI attacks
on the system voltage stability using VSI index. Understanding
the overall system vulnerability of all nodes is not
possible by looking at the individual VSI index for a single
attack vector. Therefore, using different attack vectors, we
calculate the VSI values for all nodes of the network and
then use a swarm intelligence based improved clustering
algorithm to partition the network nodes based on their
vulnerabilities. Hence, we use CF-PSO based improved
clustering technique in the next section.
3. CF-PSO based improved clustering technique
3.1. Proposed improved clustering technique
k-means is a well known unsupervised clustering algorithm
which has a wide range of applications. For n data
points and K centroids, the time complexity of k-means
algorithm is only OÃ°nÃ [22]; therefore, k-means is an efficient
clustering algorithm. However, a major problem of k-means is
that it may trap in one of the local minima. In the proposed
work, the strengths of both k-means and CF-PSO have been
exploited to find better solutions than k-means. At the
beginning, k-means algorithm is replicated n/2 times, where
n is the population size of the CF-PSO. Since 'random'
initialization is considered as the standard initialization
method for the k-means algorithm and performs well for
many types of problems [23,24], we use this approach for
206
A. Anwar et al. / Information Systems 53 (2015) 201-212
initializing k-means. Once the cluster centroids are obtained
from the replicated k-means algorithm, we use them as half
of the initial population of the swarm. The remaining half
swarm population are chosen randomly based on uniform
distribution of the solution space, which is widely accepted
as the standard initialization technique of PSO [25]. Generally,
k-means provides sub-optimal solution most of the
times. In those cases, the remaining half input vectors of
the swarm (which are generated uniformly throughout the
search-space) will still be capable to produce enough diversity
in the velocities of the particles to reach to a better
solution. The initial swarm structure is given in Fig. 1, where
each particle represents K cluster centroids and D refers the
dimension of the input data vector. It is worthwhile to
mention that the convergence characteristics of PSO depend
on the parameter settings of the algorithm.

algorithm that contains a set of coefficients to control the
systems convergence properties [26]. With the theoretical
proofs and extensive experiments, authors in [26] provide
the value of 'constriction coefficients' to ensure convergence
to a stable point. This variant of PSO with constriction
coefficients is known as 'Constriction Factor PSO'.
Authors also show that the deleterious effect of the
randomness of the PSO algorithm is controlled with the
adoption of constriction coefficients. To have a converged
behaviour, Clerc et al. suggest the following model [26]:
Position Update Equation (same as the original PSO):
xit Ã¾ 1 Â¼ xit Ã¾ vit Ã¾ 1
where xi(t) is the position vector of i-th particle at time t.

In the CF PSO formulation discussed above, the particles
travel towards an optimal solution based on the selfcognition
and social-cognition aspects [25]. The exploration
capabilities of these particles toward an optimal value
depend on the value of 'k' in the formulations (Eq. (20)).
For example,
If k 0, algorithm converges fast and particles are more
prone to local exploitation. That means, particles concentrate
a search around a promising area to refine a candidate
solution [27]. In this case, there is more possibility to
obtain a sub-optimal solution (local minimum) by the
algorithm.
If k 1, algorithm converges slow and particles are
more prone to high degree of exploration. That means,
particles explore more region/area of the search space to
refine a candidate solution [27]. In this case, the algorithm
has more possibility to find an optimal solution (global
minimum).

Based on the convergence criterion, Eberhart et al. shows
the performance of Constriction Factor PSO over the popular
variants 'adaptive weight PSO' in [28], where k Â¼ 1 and
Ï Â¼ 4.1 is considered which lead to the value of Ï Â¼ 0.7298.
In our analysis, we used the similar parameter settings to
obtain a converged solution and the total sum of the
distance of each instance to the centroid is considered as
a cost function. The step-by-step procedure of the proposed
solution is described briefly in Algorithm 1.
3.2. Evaluation of the proposed improved clustering technique
To evaluate the performance of the CF-PSO based improved
clustering method, 'shuttle' dataset [29] from NASA is
used. The benchmark dataset is available from UCI repository of
machine learning databases. The shuttle dataset has 58 000
data instances and contains 9 numerical attributes. In this
experiment, the dataset has been used to evaluate the performance
of the k-means, CF-PSO and the proposed CF-PSO based
improved clustering approaches. The algorithms have been
implemented in Matlab platform using a PC of Intel(R) core i7
at 3.7 GHz. The results obtained from 30 individual runs of each
algorithm have been summarized in Table 1, where maximum
number of iteration is considered 1000. From Table 1, we
observe that the proposed method has better solution accuracy
than any of the individual algorithms (either the k-means
algorithm or the CF-PSO based clustering) for any number of
clusters. In order to test the statistical significance, we conduct
an unpaired two tailed t-test with 95% confidence interval.
Optimal objective function values obtained from the proposed
method show statistically very significant in one case and
extremely statistically significant in the remaining five cases.
In Fig. 2, the convergence characteristics of the clustering
algorithms using k-means, CF-PSO and the proposed approach
are shown which is obtained averaging the values of 30
individual trails. From Fig. 2 and Table 1, it can be seen that
both the k-means and CF-PSO based clustering trap in a suboptimal
solution. On the other hand, CF-PSO based improved
clustering technique avoided being locally stuck and finds
better solutions as shown in Fig. 2.
4. Results and discussion
In this section, at first, we discuss about the benchmark
test systems. Then we calculate the VSI of each node of the
test systems. After that, the most and the least vulnerable

characteristics of the whole system, we cluster the
nodes which exhibits the similar behaviours. Finally, we
show the characteristics of different clusters with different
degrees of FDI attack.
4.1. Benchmark test systems and analysis tool
In this work we consider two benchmark systems, the 33bus
and the 69-bus distribution test systems, which are widely
used in distribution system analysis (e.g., [30,31]). Test system
data are obtained from [32,12], respectively. 33-bus distribution
test system has a total user demand of 3715 kW and
2300 kVAr. Total system power loss is approximately 203 kW.
This test system has 33 buses and 32 line sections. On the
other hand, the 69-bus distribution test system has a total
user demand of 3790 kW and 2690 kVAr. Total system power
loss is approximately 225 kW. This test system has 69 buses
and 68 line sections. For analysis purpose, we used Matlab
based power system simulation tool MatPower [33].

4.2. Identification and clustering of the most and the least
vulnerable nodes
First, we calculate the VSI of each node (except the
substation bus) of both 33-bus and 69-bus test systems using
Eq. (1) at the normal loading condition (that means, no attack
vector is added in this situation). The calculated VSI values are
reported in Table 2. For the 33-bus test system, Node 18 has
the minimum VSI value of 0.697 and Node 2 has the
maximum VSI value of 1.001. From the definition (Eq. (1)),
VSI Z 0 for stable operation of the distribution system. Therefore,
Node 2 is the most stable node and Node 18 is the
weakest node in terms of susceptibility to voltage collapse.
These nodes are marked bold in Table 2. For the 69-bus test
system, Node 65 has the minimum VSI value of 0.6868 and
Node 6 has the maximum VSI value of 1.03. Therefore, Node 6
is the most stable node and Node 65 is the weakest node in
terms of voltage collapse. These nodes are also marked bold in
Table 2.
Now, for both the test systems, we investigate the impact
of FDI attacks at different AMI nodes including the most and
the least sensitive node. Therefore, we increase the value of Î»
from 1 to 3 at Eqs. (16) and (17) for all AMI nodes. Here, Î»Â¼ 1
indicates that there is no attack generated and a value more
than 1 represents a positive injection of false data. The
Table 2
VSI Values of 33 bus and 69 bus test systems.
degree of FDI attack increases as the value of Î» increases.
Here Î»Â¼ 3 means that the manipulated measurement data
value is 3 times of the original measurement. The vulnerabilities
of different AMI nodes under FDI attacks are shown
in Figs. 3 and 4 for the 33 bus and the 69 bus test systems.
Here, different coloured lines represent the VSI variations of
different AMI nodes under the attack scenario. From the
simulation results, shown in Fig. 3, we see that the weakest
nodes (Node 18 for 33 bus system) have maximum deviations
under different degrees (Î») of FDI attacks. As the VSI
value becomes close to zero, the likelihood of voltage
collapse increases. From Fig. 4, similar behaviour is observed.
Node 65, the weakest node of 69 bus test system, shows the
maximum change in VSI index under the attack scenario.
Therefore, from Figs. 3 and 4, the weakest nodes identified
by the VSI analysis are more prone to voltage collapse when
AMI nodes are subjected to false data injections. Hence, we
consider them as the most vulnerable nodes in terms of FDI
attacks. Although we observed the variations of VSI values
with the change of attack magnitude, we can further study
the FDI attack impact on the voltage profile of the whole
system. Therefore, we conduct a power flow study for both
test systems considering Î»Â¼ 1, 2, and 3 using MatPower [33].
From the results of the power flow analysis, we report the
voltage profiles of all nodes in Figs. 5 and 6 respectively for

the 33 bus and the 69 bus systems. From the voltage profiles,
we also notice that Node 18 at 33 bus test system and Node 65
at 69 bus test system are the most vulnerable nodes for any
value of Î». From Figs. 5 and 6, we also observe that the impact
of FDI attack varies from node to node depending on their
physical properties. So, it is important to group the nodes with
similar characteristics. In order to do that, we vary the value of
Î» from 1 to 3 with a step size of 0.5, calculate and store the
value of VSI for each node of the 33 bus test system. Now, we
perform the CF-PSO based hybrid clustering developed in
Section 3. Here, we are interested to group the vulnerable
nodes into 3 clusters - the cluster of the least vulnerable
nodes, the moderate vulnerable nodes and the most

algorithm will make 3 clusters based on the VSI data. The
output obtained from the clustering algorithm is given in
Table 3 and can be visualized from Fig. 7. From Table 3, we see
that Nodes 7 to 18 and Nodes 26 to 33 are the most vulnerable
nodes in terms of FDI attacks. Now, if we again observe the
voltage profiles of different nodes of the 33 bus test system
(Fig. 5), we see that the nodes in the above described cluster
have more deviations of voltage magnitudes than other nodes
of the remaining clusters. In Fig. 7, red colour is used to
visualize the nodes in the most vulnerable cluster. Blue and
green indicate the nodes which belongs to the moderate and
the least vulnerable clusters. Similarly, we conduct experiments
for the 69 bus test systems. The nodes of the most, average and
the least vulnerable clusters are given in Table 4 and visualized
in Fig. 8. The Nodes 59 to 65 belong to the cluster of the most
vulnerable nodes, marked red dots in the Fig. 8. Nodes of this
most vulnerable cluster show maximum voltage deviations in
Fig. 6.

and different Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) can be used.
If an attacker manages to bypass these preventive security
techniques and compromise the devices connected with the
vulnerable nodes, an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is then
necessary to identify the attacks launched by the intruder and
take mitigating actions.
5.1. Device authentication
Authenticity of devices and data traffic is one of the
earliest and an essential step towards ensuring secured
communication. Generally, communication between the
AMI devices and the EMS/DMS is delay sensitive and traffic
intensive. On the other hand, state estimation procedure
needs near real-time operation. Therefore, authentication
schemes in a SCADA connected Smart Grid should maintain
minimal message exchange among different grid devices and
coordinating agents like EMS/DMS while security should be
assured. Li and Cao points out that the Smart Grid Intelligent
Electronic Devices (IED), e.g., AMI meters often have limited
storage [34]. To solve the storage problem, a new One-Time
Signature (OTS) based multicast authentication is proposed
that also shorten authentication delay and reduce computational
cost significantly [34]. Fouda et al. proposed a lightweight
message authentication scheme based on DiffieHellman
exchange protocol [35] that can ensure desirable
security requirements under a Smart Grid consideration. To
handle the FDI data integrity attacks (e.g., man-in-themiddle
attack, message alteration and modification), Li
et al. propose a Merkle-Tree-Based Authentication Scheme
that is more lightweight than the traditional Rivest-ShamirAdleman
(RSA) based authentication [36]. Therefore, one
effective solution to protect the vulnerable nodes against the
FDI attacks is to ensure proper device authentication schema
maintaining the Smart Grid security requirements.
5.2. Intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS)
Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) monitors the network
traffic online to prevent network intrusions by identifying
malicious activities. Not only monitoring network traffic,
but also it takes preventive actions. For example, after
identifying malicious packets, IPS can reject it or delete it.
In an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), the event logs of
malicious activities are stored with detailed information for
future analyses. For both the cases, alarm is generated to
alert the system operators. IPS and IDS can be installed in
the EMS/DMS to monitor the complete network or can be
installed in any specific device of interest. Generally, Smart
Grid has a large number of nodes and it is not possible to
install IDS/IPS at each node as it will increase the computational,
storage and economic cost significantly. Therefore, a
practical solution is to install IDS/IPS only to the vulnerable
nodes. In the following section, we discuss some recent
techniques which are proposed to detect FDI attacks and to
protect the Smart Grid.
Liu et al. propose two methods, based on nuclear norm
minimization and low rank matrix factorization, for detecting
FDI attacks [37]. In that work, the temporal correlation
of time-series measurements and the spatial nature of FDI

attacks are also studied considering missing observation values
along with different attack ratios. Lo et al. in [38] develops a
hybrid detection framework for AMI based Smart Grid. Authors
suggest that the network observability and attack detection rate
can be improved significantly by proper deployment of grid
sensors. Authors in [39] propose a defense strategy to protect
some important nodes using CUSUM algorithm. To protect the
vulnerable nodes against malicious FDI attacks, a graphical
method based defense strategy is proposed in [40]. Machine
learning approach based attack detection method is proposed
by Esmalifalak et al. in [41].
Generally, intrusion detection systems are two types: (i)
signature based and (ii) anomaly based. In a signature based
IDS, information are compared against attack signatures, which
are typically stored in a database, to identify the malicious data.
On the contrary, anomaly based IDS uses a threshold to
compare the normal and abnormal patterns, any deviation
from threshold is considered as an anomaly. The threshold is
typically calculated based on some statistical analyses. In an IT
domain, signature based IDS are very effective as there is an
abundance of signatures [42]. For a SCADA connected Smart
Grid, new types of cyber threats are increasing. The existing
power grid infrastructure, which is built couple of decades ago,
is not prepared for this. Therefore, anomaly detection technique
based on signature may not effective as the signature of the
new cyber intrusions, like FDI attacks, may not be available in
the database. Hence, an anomaly based IDS may be a good
solution to protect the vulnerable nodes of the Smart Grid. Yang
et al. highlights that power grid covers a large geographical area
which makes it very difficult to monitor and control [39].
Hence, the cyber-attack defence strategies installed to the most
vulnerable nodes obtained by the proposed method may be a
good solution to ensure the protection of a SCADA connected
Smart Grid.
6. Conclusion
In this paper, the interdependent nature of nodes in the
power grids is studied and a method, based on voltage
stability index, is utilized to identify the node characteristics
in terms of voltage collapse. Hence, we show a relationship
between the voltage stability indices and the false data
injection attacks. We establish that nodes which are more
prone to voltage collapse (less VSI value) are more vulnerable
in terms of FDI attacks. Considering the end user nodes
as AMI nodes (e.g., having Smart Meters), we conduct
extensive experimental analyses to show the impact of FDI
attacks by studying the physical properties of the Smart
Distribution Grids. From our experiments, it is evident that
injection of similar amount of false information does not
have same impact on every node. Hence, it is important to
identify similar nodes that exhibit similar characteristics
under FDI attack. In order to avoid trapping into local
minima of finding the best clusters that describe similar
node behaviour, we perform CF-PSO based hybrid clustering
to obtain the nodes of the most, the moderate and the least
vulnerable clusters for two benchmark test systems. Our
future work will address the protection and the detection
strategies of the most vulnerable AMI nodes, which is under
preparation.
