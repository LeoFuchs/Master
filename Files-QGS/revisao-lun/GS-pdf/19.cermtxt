Ramp-Induced Data Attacks on Look-Ahead Dispatch
in Real-Time Power Markets
Dae-Hyun Choi, Student Member, IEEE, and Le Xie, Member, IEEE
Abstract-This paper presents a new class of false data injection
attacks on state estimation, which may lead to financial arbitrage
in real-time power markets with an emerging look-ahead dispatch
model. In comparison with prior work of cyber attack on static dispatch
where no inter-temporal ramping constraint is considered,
we propose a novel attack strategy with which the attacker can manipulate,
in look-ahead dispatch, the limits of ramp constraints of
generators. It is demonstrated that the proposed attack may lead to
financial profits via malicious capacity withholding of selected generators,
while being undetected by the existing bad data detection
algorithm embedded in the state estimator. The feasibility of such
cyber attacks and their economic impact on real-time electricity
market operations are illustrated in the IEEE 14-bus system.

I. INTRODUCTION
C been facing an increasing number of potential cyber
RITICAL infrastructure (e.g., the electricity grid) has
attacks. Given the much stronger coupling between cyber and
physical layers of smart grid, development of cyber security
technology tailored for smart grid is of paramount importance.
The main objective of this paper is to study the impact of
cyber attacks on state estimation, which subsequently influence
the result of the newly emerging look-ahead dispatch model
in the real-time electricity market. Fig. 1(a), 1(b) illustrate the
information flow in a three-layered framework (with physical,
measurement, and control/computation layer) without and with
such cyber attacks, respectively. The information includes the
physical state such as the nodal power injection and flow and the
dispatch instruction such as the optimal generation output and
nodal price. Compared to Fig. 1(a), 1(b) describes that bad/malicious
data injected into the measurement layer can lead to
corrupted estimation of the states of the physical layer. Consequently,
the attacker could distort the feedback information
from control/communication layer back to the physical layer in
two ways, leading to 1) physical insecurity in the power grid
operations, and/or 2) financial misconduct in the power markets
as shown in Fig. 1(b). This paper contributes to topic 2) using a
more realistic dispatch model in power markets.

A large body of literature has been accumulated recently on
the subject of cyber security in power grids, ranging from risk
mitigation [1], generation control security (e.g., automatic generation
control (AGC) attack [2], [3]), control security in distribution
system [4], and privacy protection [5]-[8]. A concise
summary paper is presented in [9], including risk assessment
methodology, power system control application and cyber infrastructure
security. Meanwhile, many researchers have been
studying false data injection attacks, which malfunction the state
estimator by injecting false data into sensors. For the subject of
false data injection attacks, two major categories of work have
been presented:
• Vulnerability analysis of state estimation: a false data injection
attack was formulated and analyzed in [10], [11].
Efficient algorithm to find sparse attacks and phasor measurement
units (PMUs) placement algorithm to prevent
sparse attacks were developed in [12], [13]. A distributed
joint detection-estimation approach to malicious data attack
was presented in [14]. In [15], it was shown that the
attacker can hack the power grid without the knowledge of
the power network topology, which can be estimated using
linear independent component analysis (ICA).
• Financial risk analysis in electricity market operations:
this area examined the economic impact of false data injection
attacks on electricity market operations. Undetectable
and profitable attack strategies, which exploit virtual bidding
mechanism, were proposed in [16]. In [17], a more
general malicious data attack problem was formulated in
the real-time electricity market.
However, in [16], [17], the proposed attacks were characterized
in static economic dispatch without modeling inter-temporal
constraints.
In this paper we present a new type of potential cyber attacks
in more realistic economic dispatch model, i.e., look-ahead
dispatch. Motivated by the increasing penetration of variable

resources such as wind and solar [18], look-ahead dispatch has
been implemented by major Independent System Operators
(ISOs)/Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs) in the past
few years in order to improve the market dispatch efficiency
[19]-[21]. Look-ahead dispatch is different from conventional
static dispatch in that it calculates the optimal dispatch in an
extended period of time, taking into account inter-temporal
ramp rates of generators of different technologies. In this paper,
an attack strategy is demonstrated, in which the attacker could
withhold generation capacity for financial gain by stealthily
manipulating the ramp constraint limits of generators in look
ahead dispatch. It should be noted that the proposed attack
strategy is different from the capacity withholding methods
used for a generation company to report capacity noticeably
lower than its maximum capacity based on learning algorithm
(e.g., SA-Q-Learning algorithm) [22], [23]. In contrast, the
proposed method is to inject undetectable malicious data in
order to withhold capacity for financial misconduct in real-time
markets. The main contributions of this paper are two-fold:
1) We formulate a malicious ramp-induced data (RID) attack
problem in look-ahead dispatch. The attacker could
stealthily change the ramp constraint limits of generators
through manipulating sensors' data, aiming at increasing
the nodal price by withholding capacity of generator.
2) We propose a RID attack strategy with which the attacker
could make a profit without being detected by RTOs in
the real-time electricity market. Numerical examples are
illustrated in the IEEE-14 bus system.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section II provides
the brief overview of state estimation and real-time power
market with look-ahead dispatch model. Section III states the
cyber attack problem. The proposed attack formulation including
required conditions, attack procedure and strategy,
and attack performance metrics is elaborated in more detail in
Section IV, which is followed by illustrative examples based on
the IEEE 14-bus test system in Section V. Section VI presents
the conclusions and future work.

B. Real-Time Power Market With Look-Ahead Dispatch Model
The electric power market consists of two-settlement system,
day-ahead, and real-time spot markets. Recently, due to limited
predictability in day-ahead and high inter-temporal variability
of renewable resources (e.g., wind and solar), RTOs are upgrading
real-time market clearing engine from static dispatch
to look-ahead dispatch models for more flexible operations in
support of high penetration of variable resources [19]. For the
system operator, look-ahead dispatch is formulated as follows:

In this formulation, the objective function is to minimize the
total generation costs in (5). Equation (6) is the system-wide
energy balance equations. Equations (7) and (8) are the ramp
constraints and the physical capacity constraints of each generator,
respectively. Equation (9) is the transmission line constraints.
In this paper, we define one-step look-ahead dispatch
with as static dispatch. The Lagrangian function of the
aforementioned look-ahead dispatch is written as
where all the Lagrangian multipliers at time ( , ,
, , , , and ) are positive.

that bus 1 is the slack bus, the locational marginal price
(LMP) for each bus at time is given by

future time influence the LMPs calculation at the current
time . However, the LMP formulation in static dispatch
(one-step look-ahead) does not capture future constraints.
III. STATEMENT OF THE CYBER ATTACK PROBLEM
A general problem of cyber attack against state estimation
in economic dispatch can be illustrated in statistical signal processing
framework in Fig. 2. It provides a graphical interpretation
for the relationship among sensor's measurement, state estimation,
and economic dispatch. The state set is partitioned
into a finite number of nodal price subsets . The operation
of economic dispatch is implicitly included in the state set
. The measurement space is the collection of all realizable
sensor's measurements . The set of probability measure
provides a mathematical basis for describing the randomness of
measurements. In the power system state estimation literature,
the probability measure normally follows the Gaussian distribution.
These random measurement errors can be filtered by the
existing bad data processing algorithm. The objective of the attacker
is to move the estimate from a certain nodal price subset
to a desired nodal price subset by corrupting original measurements
into while avoiding the bad data detection. Detailed
attack model and formulation are described in Section IV.
In the above framework, a potential cyber attack in lookahead
dispatch is described as follows. The unit's initial
generation power embedded in (7) is replaced, at every
dispatch interval, by its corresponding estimate , which
is processed and delivered by the state estimator. Therefore, in
static dispatch the generation power of unit at becomes
bounded by

range of generation limited by the ramp rate of the marginal unit,

we omit , instead emphasize the time) is manipulated by the attacker,

respectively. The right diagram in Fig. 3 shows that if is
decreased to by the attacker at so that deviates
upwards from the range of , the attacker succeeds in
withholding capacity, resulting in a new dispatch output
at . As a result, the infra-marginal unit (the unit with the
next higher marginal cost) is dispatched to supply the excess demand,
consequently leading to a uniformly higher market price.
Remark 1: Define as the contribution of
the attacker to changing the nodal price. The RID attack fails
(i.e., the nodal price remains unchanged) if the value of this
contribution belongs to the following interval:
The feasible region of based on constraint (15) is defined
as the price-invulnerable region.
IV. FORMULATION OF THE RAMP-INDUCED DATA ATTACK
A. Attack Model and Undetectability
We consider the additive attack measurement model:
(15)
(16)
where is the bad data detection threshold. For bypassing the
bad data detection algorithm, the attacker aims at constructing
the attack vector so that the value of added to
still makes the above undetectable condition hold true.
B. Requirements and Procedure for a Successful RID Attack
From the analysis above, in order to implement a RID attack
with profits, the attacker is required to have the knowledge of:
R1) the system topology (e.g., distribution factor matrix),
which remains constant at every dispatch interval;
R2) the ramp rates of the targeted generators;
R3) the amount of changing system load between two consecutive
dispatch intervals.
The system topology for the targeted power system in Requirement
R1) can be simply obtained off-line by an internal intruder
in a control center or estimated by linear independent component
analysis (ICA) technique proposed in [15]. For Requirement
R2), typical ramp rates are estimable for typical generators.
Requirement R3) is feasible since the attacker can estimate
an amount of changing system load from RTOs' website. With
these assumptions, the procedure of the proposed RID attack is
summarized as follows:
Step 1): The attacker synchronizes the attack time with the
start time at every dispatch interval. This step is necessary
for injected false data to mislead economic
dispatch via the state estimator.
Step 2): The attacker determines sensors to compromise and
computes the attack vector using the proposed attack
strategy formulated in the next subsection.
Step 3): The attacker injects the attack vector into sensors'
measurements at the attack time set in Step 1). Then,
these corrupted measurements are transmitted to the
state estimator via SCADA network.
Step 4): The state estimator based on received false measurements
may lead to distorted generation output estimates.
They are utilized for setting the ramp constraints
in look-ahead dispatch.
Step 5): Consequently, the manipulated ramp constraints result
in the attacker's desired dispatch instruction.
Then, it is sent to the dispatchable generators.
Step 6): For the continuous attack, the procedure goes back
to Step 2).
C. Proposed Attack Strategy
where is the attack vector, which leads to the corrupted measurement
vector . The new residual vector can be decomIn
this subsection we formulate a ramp-induced data attack
strategy. The power system is assumed to have sufficient transmission
capacity. As the first step toward understanding the impact
of cyber attack on temporal ramp-constrained economic
dispatch, we exclude the impact of spatial transmission congestion
on the market clearning prices. In practice, temporal
ramp constraints are coexisting with spatial transmission flow
constraints. Therefore, for a successful RID attack in congested
networks the attacker should know the targeted power system
very well and as much as the system operator knows, however
this scenario is unrealistic. Developing a feasible RID attack
strategy in congested networks is beyond the scope of this paper
and referred to as a future work.
The proposed attacks are classified into the following three
types:
• Marginal unit attack: a injection measurement sensor associated
with the marginal unit is compromised.
• Binding unit attack: injection measurement sensors associated
with the binding units are compromised.
• Coordinated attack: injection measurement sensors associated
with the binding units as well as the marginal unit
are compromised.
Here a binding unit represents two types of units: an intra-marginal
unit with the lower marginal cost or an infra-marginal unit
with the higher marginal cost than a marginal unit. The following
proposed attack strategy and simulation results focus on
intra-marginal unit attack belonging to binding unit attack.
Remark 2: When there is no network transmission congestion,
it is well acknowledged that static dispatch involves a
single marginal unit and multiple binding units that produce
their minimum or maximum outputs. On the other hand,
look-ahead dispatch may involve multiple marginal units even
if there is no congestion in the the transmission network. In this
paper the marginal unit attack is associated with the marginal
unit in static dispatch.
For achieving undetectability and profitability, the attacker
computes the attack vector by compromising sensors
or , which is the solution of the following optimization
problem:

and binding unit attacks, respectively. The derivations of these
contribution terms are referred to in Appendix A. The set

tacker should reduce at in order to withhold the capacity
of unit at . Constraint (20) assures undetectability as the
parameter is tuned with an appropriate value. Constraint (21)
assures profitability since it enables unit to bind at the limit of
the up-ramp constraint, leading to the increasing nodal price.
Therefore, the attacker aims to maximize the margin in order
to make a financial gain via capacity withholding with a high
probability. The binary values of and in (21) determine the
following three types of attacks:
1) , : Marginal unit attack
2) , : Binding unit attack
3) , : Coordinated attack.
Remark 3: Compared to the capacity withholding mentioned
above, capacity withdrawing can benefit a load serving entity
(LSE) by manipulating the down-ramp constraint limit. This
type of the attack is feasible when constraint (21) is replaced
with
(23)
Remark 4: Table II summarizes the characteristics of the RID
attack, as well as the spatial attack proposed in [16]. Specifically,
we note the vulnerability index. This quantifies the vulnerability
of the targeted power system subject to each type of
attack. If variables and (power flow at the Ex-ante
market) become closer to constants and , respectively,
the power system becomes more and more vulnerable to
both attacks.
D. Attack Performance Metrics
The performance of the proposed RID attack is evaluated
using the following performance metrics:
1) Attack Profitability: Assuming that the power injection
measurement sensor at generator is compromised, we define
the attack profit efficiency (PE) of generator as the ratio of the
profit with attack to without attack:
2) Attack Undetectability: The system operator normally
performs the Chi-squares test [25] for detecting bad data in the
measurements. Bad (or malicious) data will bypass if
where is the detection confidence probability, and and
represent the number of measurements and state variables, respectively.
3) Attack Vulnerability: Since the measurement noise follows
a Gaussian distribution, the manipulated estimate of the
state at generator is also a Gaussian random variable
The probability of the distorted estimate being within the
price-invulnerable region defined in Remark 1 is expressed as
in terms of functions
where the complementary Gaussian cumulative distribution
function is defined as
and
1240
IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID, VOL. 4, NO. 3, SEPTEMBER 2013
We define as the price-invulnerable probability (PIP) with
respect to generator . From (27), (28), (29), and (30), we specify
the relationship among the ramp rate , the diagonal measurement
covariance matrix , and the PIP as follows:
1) The increase of the leads to the increase of the PIP.
2) The decrease of the values of the diagonal elements in
leads to the increase of the PIP.
In other words, the deployment of more accurate sensors and
generators with a faster ramp rate enables the power system to
become more robust to the RID attack.
V. NUMERICAL EXAMPLE
In this section the economic impact of the proposed RID attack
on the real-time electricity market operation is illustrated
in the IEEE 14-bus system as shown in Fig. 4. Measurement
configuration includes nodal power injection measurements at
all generation and load buses, and power flow measurements at
one end of each transmission line. This system has a total of 34
measurements including 14 power injection and 20 power flow
measurements, which assure the system observability. Table III
shows the five generators' operating characteristics, including
unit type (generation bus number), physical capacity limit, ramp
rate, and marginal cost (MC).

TABLE III
GENERATOR PARAMETERS OF THE IEEE 14-BUS TEST SYSTEM
In this section, three cases are simulated in the IEEE-14 bus
system:
• Case I: Marginal unit attack.
• Case II: Binding unit attack.
• Case III: Coordinated attack.
The performance of the proposed RID attack is evaluated
based on the one day load profile with a 5-min resolution. This
load profile is obtained by interpolating a 15-min daily data in
the ERCOT website. The load is scaled down to be consistent
with the IEEE 14-bus test system's peak load data. The common
goal of all three cases is to withhold the capacity of generator
3 for the purpose of making a profit. A power injection sensor
at generation bus 3 is compromised in Case I whereas a power
injection sensor at generation 1 is compromised in Case II. Case
III represents the coordinated attack, which compromises both
sensors targeted in Case I and Case II.
Fig. 5 show the comparison of the LMPs between static
and look-ahead dispatch without attack and with attack
in Cases I, II, and III. Due to no network transmission congestion,
the prices in these figures denote the uniform LMPs for
all the buses at every dispatch interval. In Fig. 5(a), the LMPs
in look-ahead dispatch are oscillating around 40 $/MWh more
than the ones in static dispatch. This phenomenon is due to the
fact that the binding of generator 3 at the up- or down-ramp constraints
at time makes its corresponding Lagrangian multiplier,
or , become positive. As shown
in (11), this leads to different LMPs at time than the ones from
static dispatch. We observe from Fig. 5(b), 5(c), 5(d) that the
LMPs in both dispatch models tend to increase with attack. This
observation implies that the attacker successfully withholds the

capacity of generator 3 by lowering its up-ramp constraint limit
through the reduction of the initial estimate . Consequently,
this leads to the shift of the marginal unit to another
one with a more expensive marginal cost.
Table IV shows the attack performance of Cases I, II, and
III in both static and look-ahead dispatch. The second and third
columns of this table indicate the attack profit efficiency at generation
bus 3. We can observe from the comparison of these two
columns several facts. First, the PE values in all three cases of
both dispatch models are larger than 100. It indicates that the
attacker makes an additional profit using the proposed attack
strategy. Second, for all three cases, the PE in look-ahead dispatch
is higher than in static dispatch. This observation might
result from the fact that the attack leads to more increase of
the nodal price in look-ahead dispatch than in static dispatch.
Lastly, among three cases, Case I and Case II attacks yield the
largest and smallest PE, respectively. The PE in Case III is between
Case I and Case II. This result is natural since Case II
and Case III attacks require an extra effort for withholding the
binding unit's capacity as well as the marginal unit's capacity
so that both attacks fail with a higher probability than Case I attack.
Fig. 6 shows the amount of generator 3's capacity which
all three attacks withhold between 80 and 90 time intervals. As
expected, it is verified that Case I, Case III, and Case II attacks
withhold capacity the most in a descending order. This fact also
justifies the third observation mentioned above. The values of
the estimated objective functions for all three cases are shown
in the last column of Table IV. Based on the measurement configuration
with and , the threshold of the
Chi-squares test with a 99% confidence level is set to 37.6. For
undetectability, the parameter in (20) is set to 3. Therefore, all
three attacks in both dispatch models succeed in avoiding the
Chi-squares bad data detection.
Table VI shows the sensitivity of Case I attack performance
with respect to the attack magnitude. In this table, the attack relative
magnitude (ARM) is defined as where
denotes an infinity norm. We observe from this table
that the increase of the ARM leads to more profit (the third and
fourth rows) in both dispatch models. However, the estimated
objective function (the fifth row) used for the Chi-squares bad
data test increases and the PIP (the last row) decreases. This implies
that as the ARM increases the attack becomes more vulnerable
to the bad data detection and fails with an increasing
probability. Table V shows Case I attack performance with the
varying ramp rate of generator 3 and measurement variance of
Fig. 6. of static and look-ahead dispatch without attack and with
Case I, II, and III attacks.
TABLE IV
ATTACK PERFORMANCE IN STATIC AND LOOK-AHEAD DISPATCH
sensors. We first observe from this table that as the ramp rate
of generator 3 increases the PE in both dispatch models decreases.
Another observation is that the decrease of measurement
variance leads to the decrease of the attack profit. These
observations imply that the nodal prices become less manipulable,
which is verified with the increasing PIP in Table V.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
This paper is concerned about cyber data attacks on state estimation
and their effects on time-coupled look-ahead dispatch.
With the assumption of no network transmission congestion, we
propose an undetectable ramp-induced data attack method with
which the attacker could manipulate the ramp constraint limits
of generators for withholding generation capacity, subsequently
leading to making a profit in the real-time power market. Numerical
examples simulated in the IEEE 14-bus system demonstrate
the undetectability and profitability of the proposed cyber
data attack.
In future work, a system-theoretical framework to analyze
the effect of various types of spatial and temporal data attacks
on real-time electricity market operations will be developed.
The key challenge lies in how to analytically quantify the impact
of manipulated sensor's measurement on the nodal price
in space-time coupled optimization problem. Another important
future direction is to design the robust real-time pricing model
as countermeasures to mitigate the financial risks of a variety of
cyber data attacks.
