We next introduce the proposed cyber-enabled controller
that facilitates the overall cyber-physical smart grid system
to achieve stability against disturbances.
III. CYBER-ENABLED CONTROL FOR SMART GRID
Synchronous generators typically utilize power control
schemes (e.g. exciter and governor controls) to help adjust
a generator's internal settings to respond to dynamics in the
power grid. However, these local power control systems are often
insufficient because of their slow reaction to rapid systemwide
changes. Moreover, synchronous generators, without
external power control as described in Eq. (3), cannot achieve
transient stability alone in the presence of a fault or when a
fault is cleared after the critical clearing time either due to a
malfunction or cyber attack. We develop a parametric feedback
linearization (PFL) controller that utilizes an external power
source at Generator i to achieve transient stability. Thus, the
swing equation for Generator i after including PFL control
input Ui becomes
δ˙i
ω˙ i
=

M1i [−Di ωi + Pa,i + Ui] .
The proposed controller responds to the dynamics of the
power system by absorbing or injecting a specified amount
of real power, this is facilitated by the incorporation of a fastacting
ESS at the designated generator. Specifically, a positive
Ui value would correspond to the controller of Generator i
injecting power into the generator bus, and a negative Ui value
indicates that power is being absorbed from the generator bus.
The PFL controller is designed to asymptotically drive the
frequency of the system generators into stability following the
occurrence of a disturbance; i.e., after the activation of the PFL
controller it is required that lim ωi(t) = 0 ∀i ∈ {1, . . . , N }.
t→∞
Additionally, the PFL controller is to maintain phase cohesiveness
between the generators of the power system, the absolute
difference between the phases of any two generators should
be less than 100◦ [1], [13].
Feedback control depends on measurements from the system
to generate the control signal required to drive the overall
system (or one of the system variables) into a desirable state. In
feedback control the controller compares the measured value
with a desired value, and consequently generate a control
signal to minimize the difference. Feedback linearization [14,
Ch. 13] transforms a nonlinear plant into an equivalent closedloop
linear system. One approach to implement feedback
linearization is to introduce a control signal to cancel out
the nonlinear terms in the system dynamics, this would result
in the closed-loop system exhibiting (full or partial) linear
dynamics.
We next detail the design of the proposed centralized and
decentralized control schemes.
A. Centralized Control Scheme
A centralized parametric feedback linearization (CPFL)
controller relies on receiving timely PMU measurements from
all generators in the power system to calculate the control action.
Mathematically, the CPFL control for frequency stability
and phase cohesion is expressed as
Ui = − (Pa,i + αi ωi + βi (δi − δi∗)) ,
(5)
where αi ≥ 0 is called the frequency stability parameter, βi ≥
0 is the phase stability parameter, and δ∗ = [δ1∗, δ2∗, . . . , δN∗ ]T
is the desired phase of the system generators. The βi (δi − δi∗)
term will drive the CPFL controller to settle the phase of the
system generators on δ∗. The values of δ∗ are selected such
that |δi∗ − δj∗| ≤ 100◦ ∀i, j ∈ {1, . . . , N }. Consequently, phase
cohesiveness is maintained during and after the controller's
active time.
The CPFL control will fully cancel the nonlinear terms in
the swing equation provided that all PMU measurements are
obtained. Consequently, the swing equation of the interconnected
power system reduces into a decoupled linear equation
after implementing the CPFL controller.
(4)
We next present the stability analysis of the CPFL control.
Substituting the CPFL control in Eq. (5) into the swing
equation in Eq. (4) results in
x˙ i = Ai xi + bi δi∗ ,
(6)
where xi = [δi, ωi]T is called the state variable of Generator i,
T 0 1
bi = h0, Mβii i , and Ai = −βi −(Di+αi) . To check
Mi Mi
the stability of the power system after implementing the
proposed CPFL control, the eigenvalues of Ai are calculated
and checked to determine if they lie in the left-hand complex
plane. The eigenvalues of Ai are calculated as
λ1,2 =
1
2Mi
h−(Di + αi) ± p(Di + αi)2 − 4βiMii . (7)
When evaluated, both eigenvalues are found to lie in the lefthand
complex plane. Further, Re(λ1,2) < 0; consequently,
the power system is globally asymptotically stable under the
proposed CPFL controller [14, Theorem 4.5].
B. Decentralized Control Scheme
As previously motivated in Section I, the cyber communication
channels relaying PMU measurements from sensors to
the controllers are vulnerable to congestion or DoS attacks.
A decentralized PFL (DPFL) controller only utilizes the measurements
from the PMU situated near the local generator bus.
Mathematically, the DPFL control is expressed as
Ui = − (αiωi + βi(δi − δi∗)) .
The DPFL control utilizes local measurements only, and as a
result the accelerating power term (Pa,i) cannot be estimated
and consequently cannot be cancelled, resulting in a partially
linearized control system.
Next, we present the stability analysis of the DPFL control.
Similar to our analysis for the CPFL control, the following is
found as we substitute Eq. (8) into Eq. (4)
x˙ i = Ai xi + bi δi∗ + h0, M1i i
T
Pa,i .
Using the approximations for the relevant terms in Pe,i in
Eq. (2), it can be shown that Pa,i reduces to
Pa,i ≈ Pm,i − δiΔi + Δk ,
Consequently,

Both eigenvalues are found to lie in the left-hand complex
plane. Consequently, the power system is stable under the
proposed DPFL controller.
C. Combined Centralized-Decentralized Control Scheme
We propose the combined centralized-decentralized PFL
(CDPFL) controller as a mediator solution for the power system
when communication latency or DoS attack impacts the
cyber-enabled centralized control performance. While cyberenabled
centralized control is efficient and effective, the delay
or lack of PMU information hinders it highly ineffective. An
intuitive approach is to switch from centralized to decentralized
control in the absence of PMU information; hence, we
propose the combined mode of our PFL control.
Let τ ≥ 0 be the latency between the PMUs and the
controller, and let τ ∗ denote the maximum latency below
which the CPFL control can effectively stabilize the system.
The proposed CDPFL is then expressed as
Ui =
− (Pa,i + αiωi + βi(δi − δi∗)) if τ < τ ∗ (CPFL)
− (αiωi + βi(δi − δi∗)) if τ ≥ τ ∗ (DPFL).
(13)
It is important to observe that the CDPFL control waits until
τ ∗ before activating the DPFL control, and this results in
a considerable deviation in the system state following the
disturbance. To address this issue, the parameter αi can be
optimized for a more aggressive control action to stabilize the
power system.

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS
The different PFL control schemes proposed in this work
are numerically evaluated. The CPFL and DPFL controls are
first evaluated for different balanced three phases faults with
and without the governor control activated at the generators.
A robustness analysis of the CDPFL control against cyberphysical
disturbances is also conducted.
For the following numerical results, the stability time of
a Generator i is the time it takes the controller to keep the
frequency stable (i.e., |ωi| ≤ 0.02) permanently. Further,
for the purpose of clarity, the following figures show the
performance results for the first four synchronous generators;
however, similar behaviour is observed for the rest of the
generators.
The New England power system is considered. The power
system is assumed to be running in normal secure state from
t = 0 to t = 0.5 seconds. However, a balanced three-phase
fault occurs at Bus 17 at t = 0.5 seconds. Then, Line 17-18
is tripped out to clear the fault at t = 0.6 seconds. Finally, the
PFL controller is activated on all generators at t = 0.7 seconds.
For the balanced three-phase fault detailed above, the frequency
and phase of the first four generators in the New
England power system are shown in Fig. 2 for the case when
the CPFL control is activated. Moreover, Fig. 3 shows the
frequency and phase of the system generators under the same

fault scenario with DPFL control activated. Compared to the
DPFL controller, these results show that CPFL control scheme
achieves more efficient performance.
As a summary of the above numerical results, a detailed
record of the stability time of each generator (except Generator
10) in the New England power system is shown in Table I.
The stability time is shown for the proposed CPFL and DPFL
control with and without the generators' governor activated.
In addition, Table II shows the average stability time of the
system generators (except Generator 10) under different cases
of faults. In this table, Case Study 1 refers to the previously
studied case (i.e., a three-phase fault occurs at Bus 17 at t
= 0.5 seconds, Line 17-18 is tripped out at t = 0.6 seconds,
and the controller is activated at t = 0.7 seconds). Further,
Case Study 2 represents the situation when a fault occurs at
Bus 11 then Line 10-11 is tripped out. Moreover, a threephase
fault occurs at Bus 22 and Line 21-22 is tripped out
in Case Study 3. Finally, the fault is located in Bus 39 and
Line 28-39 is tripped out to clear the fault in Case Study 4.
We further investigate the performance of the CPFL controller
versus communication links latency that affect the PMU
measurements arrival time at the controllers. Fig. 4 shows
that beyond a certain latency value (around 170 msec in
this case), the stability time jumps from about 4 seconds to
around 18 seconds (the simulation duration). In other words,
if the latency is above this value, the CPFL controller cannot
stabilize the power system.
Motivated by this analysis we investigate the CDPFL control
for the aforementioned system against a cyber-physical disturbance.
Similar to Case Study 1, a physical fault occurs in the
power system at t = 0.5 seconds, the CPFL control is activated
at t = 0.7 seconds, and a worst-case cyber attack (where all
communication links to the control center are jammed or under
DoS attacks) occurs at t = 0.8 seconds. The CDPFL controller
tolerates a wait period of τ ∗ = 150 msec before switching to
DPFL at t = 0.95 seconds. The proposed CDPFL is shown
to be able to stabilize the power system under the worst-case
DoS scenario as shown in Fig. 5.
V. CONCLUSIONS
This paper proposes a frequency and phase stabilizing controller
for smart grid systems under severe fault or malfunction
of protection devices. The design of the proposed parametric
controller is motivated by the feedback linearization control
theory, and the controller relies on receiving frequent system
state information to actuate fast-acting energy storages
to balance the swing equation and drive the power system
to stability. The controller is evaluated under centralized
and decentralized system designs, and further a combined
centralized-decentralized control scheme is proposed to enhance
robustness against long communication delays or denialof-service
attacks.
System performance is investigated when the proposed
controller is applied to the New England 39-bus 10-generator
power system. Further, the performance is studied when both
the proposed and governor controls are activated in the power
system. Results of this work show the effectiveness of the
proposed controller in stabilizing the power grid and making
it more resilient to cyber-physical disturbances.
