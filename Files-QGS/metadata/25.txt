Title: Facilitating Biomedical Systematic Reviews Using Ranked Text Retrieval and Classification

Keywords: Information Retrieval, Machine Learning

Abstract: 
Searching and selecting articles to be included in systematic reviews is a real challenge for healthcare agencies responsible for publishing these reviews. The current practice of manually reviewing all papers returned by complex hand-crafted boolean queries is human labour-intensive and difficult to maintain. We demonstrate a two-stage searching system that takes advantage of ranked queries and support-vector machine text classification to assist in the retrieval of relevant articles, and to restrict results
to higher-quality documents. Our proposed approach shows significant work saved in the systematic review process over a baseline of a keyword-based retrieval system.
