Title: Automatically Locating Results to Support Systematic Reviews in Software Engineering

Keywords: Evidence-Based Software Engineering, Systematic Review, Information Retrieval

Abstract: 
Background: Systematic Reviews are extremely dependent on human effort and, therefore, costly and time consuming. Some authors in Software Engineering are starting to research the use of computer support to reduce human labor in some tasks of the process. 

Aim: Define a method for automatic location of sentences that describe the results in an unstructured scientific paper aiming to reduce the human effort. 

Method: Three sentence classification methods were analyzed and a new sentence classification method was proposed and tested with the same input set used in the other methods. 

Results: The method proposed in this work reached rates ranged between 60% and 72% of recall of the sentences describing results of the papers. Conclusions: The proximity between the recall rates found in automatic tests conducted with the proposed method
and in a test with humans confirms the feasibility of this technique for automating part of the process.
